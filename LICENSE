The default license of this repository is the MIT License (copied below), but
LICENSE files in subdirectories override this default. As a result, the
majority of the source code falls under the MIT license, however, some parts
are under two non-commercial licenses (see below). The Genome Browser Web CGI
programs are under a non-commercial license by UC, the BLAT program suite is
licensed by Kent Informatics.  Two libraries are bundled for convenience, they 
can be redistributed under their original open source licenses.

As a result, if you are a non-commercial entity, you can use all the source
code for free. However, if you are commercial, you may need to pay if you want
to install a web-based Genome Browser locally or use BLAT locally, either 
as the blat/gfServer/gfClient command line programs or the webBlat GUI 
running locally on your servers.
 
This means that all UCSC Genome Browser command-line tools and their required
libraries are released under the MIT License. This includes our various file
format converters, such as bedToBigBed and wigToBigWig, and any tools to create
files needed for track hubs. They can be redistributed in any way necessary.

In total, the code in this repository is covered by five different licenses:

FREE Licenses:

1. the default is the MIT license (attached below) 
  - this includes, for example, all code to read and write the Genome Browser
    file formats, such as bigBed and bigWig, and the command line tools for
    these, bedToBigBed, wigToBigWig and the tagStorm tools and the parasol job
    scheduler.
  - also, third-party code from open-source projects bundled for convenience,
    in src/htslib (MIT)
2. A modified BSD license for src/htslib/cram/, see src/htslib/LICENSE. 
   Copyright (C) 2012-2014 Genome Research Ltd.
3. Public domain "with attribution" license, see src/optimalLeaf/LICENSE

NON-COMMERCIAL licenses:

4. A non-commercial license from UC for the genome browser website code in 
   the following subdirectories of src/hg/ (see the LICENSE files in these directories):
     cgilib hgApi hgCollection hgFileSearch hgFileUi hgGateway
     hgGene hgGenome hgIntegrator hgPal hgPcr hgPhyloPlace hgPublicSessions
     hgSession hgSuggest hgTables hgTrackUi hgTracks hgVai hgc hubApi near
     visiGene liftOver
5. A non-commercial license from Kent Informatics for the BLAT and isPCR code
   in src/blat/, src/isPcr and src/jkOwnLib/, for more information see
   https://genome.ucsc.edu/license/ and http://www.kentinformatics.com/

See https://genome.ucsc.edu/license/ for more details and on how to obtain a license
for commercial use for the licenses (4) and (5). Commercial users interested in BLAT 
should contact kent@soe.ucsc.edu for access to other modules including jkOwnLib
and blat. 

The code in src/htslib is distributed under two licenses as noted in the LICENSE
file in that directory.
