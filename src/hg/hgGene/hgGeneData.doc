This document describes the configuration system
for the hgGene cgi-script, which displays a lot
of information on a single gene.  The configurations
are stored in the hgGeneData directory.  This
directory contains subdirectories for each organism,
and sub-subdirectories for each assembly of the
organism.  Configuration information can appear at
any level of this directory structure, and stuff
at the lower levels overrides stuff at the higher
levels.

The configuration files currently are all in a
simple format (.ra) in which records are separated
by blank lines, and each field in a record is on it's
own line. The first word in a line is the name of the
field.  All records begin with a name field.

The files are :
  genome.ra - genome-specific information that applies to
      all sections of the hgGene page.
  section.ra - this contains a record for each section.
  links.ra - information used to construct the quick links
      section.
  otherOrgs.ra - information used to construct the section
      with links to homologous genes in other organisms.
A more detailed description of each of these files follows.
Note that the microarray section also uses the columnDb.ra
files in the hgNearData directory.  

genome.ra - This file contains a single record.  All fields
are required. The fields are:
    name - Always 'genome'.
    nameSql - SQL statement to translate from database gene id to
       gene name.
    proteinSql - SQL statement to translate from gene id to 
       SwissProt accession.
    descriptionSql - SQL statement to translate from gene it to
       one or two line gene description.
    knownGene - Name of primary gene table in genePred format.
    knownGenePep - Name of table containing protein sequence for genes.
    pfamDescSql - SQL statement to look up.  This statement currently
       needs to be updated when a new proteins database is built.

section.ra - This file contains a record for each section of
hgGene.  All fields are required. The fields are:
    name - Symbolic name for section.  The user doesn't see this.
    shortLabel - Short (one or two word) user visible label for section.
    longLabel - One line description of section.
    priority - Defines order of sections.  

links.ra - This file contains a record for each potential quick
link.  Some fields are optional.  The fields are:
    name - Symbolic name of link.
    shortLabel - Short (one or two word) user visible label for link.
    longLabel - One line description of section.
    idSql - SQL statement that translates from our gene ID to the
         ID used for the link (in the HREF part of the URL).
	 This may return up to three columns.
    url - Printf formatted statement to construct HREF part of URL.
         There should be as many %s's in this as there are columns
	 returned by idSql, up to three.
    databases - (optional) Space-separated list of databases that
         have to be present to display this section.
    tables - (optional) Space-separated list of tables that have to
         be present to display this section.
    hgsid - (optional) If this field is present then the session ID
         CGI variable is added to the URL.  This is used for links
	 back into genome.ucsc.edu.  By convention if present the value
	 is 'on'.
    dbInUrl - (optional) Add db= to url in link.
    preCutAt - (optional) If present part of the gene ID is removed
         before using the idSql.  The code looks for the preCutAt
	 value in the gene ID, and remove it, and everything after it.
	 This is used only in the Fruitfly database currently, and in
	 that context goes from transcript to gene ID for the BDGP
	 ID's without having to have another table.
    postCutAt - (optional) Removes suffix from first column returned
        by idSql query using same rules as preCutAt and for the same
	reason.
    nameSql - (optional) SQL statement that translates from our gene ID to the
         user visible name in the other database.  If this field is missing
	 idSql will be used instead.  This may return up to three columns.
    nameFormat - (optional) Printf formatted statement to construct
         user visible name from results of nameSql query.  Should
	 have one %s for each column in nameSql.  Actually though
	 in recent versions of the code neither nameSql or nameFormat
	 are actually used by the program.
    priority - Defines order of links in link table.

otherOrgs.ra - This file contains a record potential other organism.
The fields currently are the same as links.ra.
