<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows the sequences used in the 09 May 2016 <em>Mus musculus (house mouse)</em>/GCA_001632555.1_C57BL_6NJ_v1 genome assembly.
</p>
<p>
Genome assembly procedures are covered in the NCBI

<p>
The definition of the gaps in this assembly is from the AGP file:

In dense mode, this track depicts the contigs that make up the 
currently viewed scaffold. 
Contig boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Where gaps
exist between contigs, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  The relative order and orientation of the contigs
within a scaffold is always known; therefore, a line is drawn in the graphical
display to bridge the blocks.</p>
<p>
This assembly has 49,821 component parts, with the following principal types of parts:
<ul>
<li>W - whole genome shotgun (count: 49,821)</li>
</ul></p>
