<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows the sequences used in the 26 Apr 2016 <em>Mus musculus (house mouse)</em>/GCA_001624505.1_DBA_2J_v1 genome assembly.

In dense mode, this track depicts the contigs that make up the 
currently viewed scaffold. 
Contig boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Where gaps
exist between contigs, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  The relative order and orientation of the contigs
within a scaffold is always known; therefore, a line is drawn in the graphical
display to bridge the blocks.</p>
<p>
This assembly has 42,324 component parts, with the following principal types of parts:
<ul>
<li>W - whole genome shotgun (count: 42,324)</li>
</ul></p>
