<h2>Description</h2>
<h2>Display Convention and Configuration</h2>
<p>
Pairwise alignments of each species to the mouse genome are displayed as a grayscale density plot
(in pack mode) or as a wiggle (in full mode) that indicates the proportion of matching bases in the
target species. In squish mode, the number of matching bases in all species is shown as a single
wiggle track.</p>
<p>
Checkboxes on the track configuration page allow selection of the species to include in the pairwise
display.</p>
<p>
To view detailed information about the alignments at a specific position, zoom the display in to
30,000 or fewer bases, then click on the alignment.</p>

<h3>Base Level</h3>
<p>
Codon translation is available in base-level display mode if the displayed region is identified as a
coding segment. To display this annotation, select the species for translation from the pull-down
menu in the Codon Translation configuration section at the top of the page. Then, select one of the
following modes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>No codon translation:</b> The gene annotation is not used; the bases are displayed without
    translation.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Use default species reading frames for translation:</b> The annotations from the genome
    displayed in the <em>Default species to establish reading frame</em> pull-down menu are used to
    translate all the aligned species present in the alignment.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Use reading frames for species if available, otherwise no translation:</b> Codon translation
    is performed only for those species where the region is annotated as protein coding.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Use reading frames for species if available, otherwise use default species:</b> Codon
    translation is done on those species that are annotated as being protein coding over the aligned
    region using species-specific annotation; the remaining species are translated using the default
    species annotation.</li></ul>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
For this assembly hub, a Progressive Cactus alignment was generated using the Genbank version of
these assemblies. The reference mouse (mm10) as well as the reference rat (rn6) were included as
well. Here is the guide tree for this alignment:</p>
<p>
<img src="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/images/phylo/mouseStrains_18way.png"
alt="Mouse Genomes Phylogeny"></p>
<p>
Due to the highly similar nature of the laboratory mice strains, this tree was binarized as
accurately as possible, but incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) is prevalent and as a result the guide
tree may not be correct in all regions. This has minimal effect on alignment quality except in
regions where insertions and deletions are under ILS.</p>
<p>
The alignment underlying this track is also available
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/hubs/mouseStrains/mouseStrains_1509.hal"
target="_blank">here</a> in HAL format. Due to load times problems with HAL files, the HAL file was
used to generate the underlying bigMaf files for this track and is not directly part of the hub.</p>
