This directory contains files with instructions for building the hg38 human genome browser
and annotation tracks.

The assembly build and basic tracks are described in hg38.txt.  If you are creating a set of
related tracks or working on a project that will expand to include multiple tracks, consider
creating a <project>.txt file instead of adding your notes to hg38.txt.
