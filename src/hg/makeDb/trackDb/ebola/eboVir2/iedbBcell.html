<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
This track shows protein sequences recognized by antibodies 
as annotated by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) 
<a href="http://iedb.org" target="_BLANK">Immune Epitope Database</a> (IEDB). 
Only sequences with a positive assay outcome are shown on the track. All fields annotated by
IEDB and exported in their "compact" file are shown on the details page, which also provides links
back to the IEDB.  </p>
<p>
Peptide matches are labeled with the name of the antibody and the host organism, separated by a slash.
When the antibody does not have a name in IEDB, the first six letters of the peptide are shown instead.
