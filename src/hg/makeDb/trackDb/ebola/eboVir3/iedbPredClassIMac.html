<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows peptides that are predicted to be displayed by 
macaque class I MHCs.
</p>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
Peptides are shaded by IC50 values and split into subtracks by HLA-alleles.

<h2>Methods</h2>
For human epitope prediction, binding affinity for all possible 9-mer peptides
from each protein sequence to a set of 27 HLA alleles that are most frequent in
the global population, using the SMM method available in the <a
href="http://tools.immuneepitope.org/main/tcell/" target="_blank">IEDB MHC class
I binding prediction tool</a>. All peptides with predicted binding affinity (expressed
as IC50 nM) below previously optimized allele-specific thresholds were
selected as predicted binders. In the case of rhesus macaque class I T cell
epitope prediction, the binding affinity of all 9-mer peptides was predicted
for a total of 19 alleles (7 Indian and 12 Chinese rhesus macaques) that are
most frequent in these species. The binding affinity predictions utilized the
&quot;IEDB recommended&quot; method from the IEDB MHC class I binding prediction tool.
Peptides with the IEDB consensus percentile rank &lt;= 1.0 were selected. Lower
values for either IC50 or percentile rank indicate stronger binding.<p>
