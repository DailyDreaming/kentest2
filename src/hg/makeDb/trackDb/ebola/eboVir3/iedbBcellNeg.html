<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
This track shows protein sequences assayed but not recognized by antibodies.
They were annotated by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) 
<a href="http://www.iedb.org/" target="_blank">Immune Epitope Database</a> (IEDB). 
Only sequences with at least one negative assay outcome are shown on the track.
All fields annotated by IEDB and exported in their &quot;compact&quot; file are shown on
the details page, which also provides links back to the IEDB.  </p>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
Peptide matches are labeled with the name of the antibody and the host organism, separated by a 
slash.
When the antibody does not have a name in IEDB, the first six letters of the peptide are shown 
instead.
