<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows the genomic positions of protein secondary structures and amino acid modifications
in the <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/" target="_blank">UniProt/SwissProt</A> database.
These data have been curated from scientific publications by the UniProt staff.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
Genomic locations of UniProt/SwissProt protein secondary structures and amino acid modifications
are labeled with the feature name (e.g. helix, beta, coiled-coil, disulf bond, glyco) at a given
position. 
</p>

<p>
Mouse over a feature to see the UniProt comments.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
UniProt sequences were aligned to RefSeq sequences first with BLAT, then lifted
to genome positions with pslMap. UniProt protein secondary structures and amino acid modifications
were parsed from the UniProt XML file. The features were then mapped to the genome through the
alignment using the pslMap program. This mapping approach
draws heavily on the <A HREF="https://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/LS-SNP/"
TARGET="_BLANK">LS-SNP</A> pipeline by Mark Diekhans. The complete script is
part of the kent source tree and is located in src/hg/utils/uniprotMutations.
