<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows the genomic positions of natural and artifical amino acid variants
in the <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/" target="_blank">UniProt/SwissProt</a> database.
The data has been curated from scientific publications by the UniProt staff.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
Genomic locations of UniProt/SwissProt variants are labeled with the amino acid
change at a given position and, if known, the abbreviated disease name. A
&quot;?&quot; is used if there is no disease annotated at this location, but the
protein is described as being linked to only a single disease in UniProt.
</p>

<p>
Mouse over a mutation to see the UniProt comments.
</p>

<p>
Artificially introduced mutations are colored green and naturally occurring variants are colored
red. For full information about a particular variant, click the &quot;UniProt variant&quot; linkout.  
The &quot;UniProt record&quot; linkout lists all variants of a particular protein sequence.
The &quot;Source articles&quot; linkout lists the articles in PubMed that originally described
the variant(s) and were used as evidence by the UniProt curators.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
UniProt sequences were aligned to RefSeq sequences first with BLAT, then lifted
to genome positions with pslMap. UniProt variants were parsed from the UniProt
XML file.  The variants were then mapped to the genome through the alignment
using the pslMap program.  This mapping approach
draws heavily on the <A HREF="https://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/LS-SNP/"
TARGET="_BLANK">LS-SNP</A> pipeline by Mark Diekhans. The complete script is
part of the kent source tree and is located in src/hg/utils/uniprotMutations.
