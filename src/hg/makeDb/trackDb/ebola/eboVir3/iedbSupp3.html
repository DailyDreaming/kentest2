<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows peptides that are predicted to be displayed by 
human class II MHCs.</p>

Peptides are shaded by percentile.

<h2>Methods</h2>
For human epitope predictions, 15-mer peptides overlapping by 10 aa residues
were generated from aligned sequences, to avoid redundant peptides that share
the same 9-mer binding core. For each 15-mer peptide, the
binding affinity was predicted (expressed as the IEDB consensus percentile
rank) for seven class II human HLA alleles (HLA-DRB1*03:01, HLA-DRB1*07:01,
HLA-DRB1*15:01, HLA-DRB3*01:01, HLA-DRB3*02:02, HLADRB4*01:01 and
HLA-DRB5*01:01), using the <a
href="http://tools.immuneepitope.org/main/tcell/" target="_blank">MHC
class I binding prediction tool</a> (&quot;IEDB recommended&quot; method). Predicted
binders were selected based on the median consensus percentile rank estimated from the
consensus percentile ranks for the seven alleles. All peptides with median
consensus percentile rank &lt;= 20.0 were selected as predicted binders, the
threshold being previously optimized for capturing 50% of class II human T cell
responses.
