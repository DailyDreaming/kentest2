<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
This track displays variants identified by Gire <em>et al.</em> in 81 isolates
from the 2014 strain of Ebola virus (78 from Sierra Leone and 3 from Guinea)
that are specific to the 2014 strain. At least one 2014 isolate carries a base not found 
elsewhere in the EBOV alignment.

Items are labeled by ancestral nucleotide and 2014-derived nucleotide.
Non-coding variants are black, synonymous variants are green,
and missense variants are red and also labeled by gene and amino acid change.

in 2014 isolates and, for missense changes, the
