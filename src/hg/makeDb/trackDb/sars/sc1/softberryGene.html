<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Fgenesv+ predictions are based on Softberry's gene-finding software for viral genomes. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The Fgenesv gene prediction algorithm is based on pattern recognition of 
different types of signals and Markov chain models of coding regions. The 
optimal combination of these features is found by dynamic programming; a 
set of gene models is constructed along the given sequence. Fgenesv+ is the 
Softberry automatic annotation pipeline that uses the Fgenesv gene predictor 
and annotations of predicted proteins, comparing them with protein databases.
