Note: It was assumed that the SARS orf1ab polyprotein processing map
should be similar to that of murine hepatitis virus. However, of the
two MHV papain-like proteinases, only PLP-2 seems to be well conserved
for SARS coronavirus. The putative mature peptides located downstream
from nsp1 are probably cleaved from the polyprotein by the nsp2
proteinase (3CL-PRO).  The preliminary annotation of
putative proteins and mature peptides was conducted at the NCBI.</P>

Also note: There is a putative frameshift of -1 at genomic coord 13383 
(protein base 4379).  </P>
