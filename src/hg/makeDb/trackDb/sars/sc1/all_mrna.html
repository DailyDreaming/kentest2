<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows alignments between viral mRNAs
in GenBank and the SARS draft sequence. </P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track follows the display conventions for 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#PSLDisplay" 
TARGET=_blank>PSL alignment tracks</A>. In dense display mode, the items that
are more darkly shaded indicate matches of better quality. </P>
<P>
The description page for this track has a filter that can be used to change 
the display mode, alter the color, and include/exclude a subset of items 
within the track. This may be helpful when many items are shown in the track 
display, especially when only some are relevant to the current task.  </P>
<P>
To use the filter:
<OL>
<LI>Type a term in one or more of the text boxes to filter the mRNA 
display. For example, to apply the filter to all mRNAs submitted by a 
specific author, type the name of the individual in the author box. To view 
the list of valid terms for each text box, consult the table in the Table 
Browser that corresponds to the factor on which you wish to filter. For 
example, the &quot;author&quot; table contains all the names 
that can be entered into the author text box. Wildcards may also be used in 
the filter.
<LI>If filtering on more than one value, choose the desired combination
logic. If &quot;and&quot; is selected, only mRNAs that match all filter 
criteria will be highlighted. If &quot;or&quot; is selected, mRNAs that 
match any one of the filter criteria will be highlighted.
<LI>Choose the color or display characteristic that should be used to 
highlight or include/exclude the filtered items. If &quot;exclude&quot; is 
chosen, the browser will not display mRNAs that match the filter criteria. 
If &quot;include&quot; is selected, the browser will display only those 
mRNAs that match the filter criteria.
</OL></P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
GenBank viral mRNAs were aligned against the SARS draft sequence using the
blat program (translated alignments). 
These alignments were <b>not</b> filtered (as they usually would be 
for vertebrate genomes) because of the rapid evolution of viruses and the
greater variance. </P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
This track was produced at UCSC from mRNA sequence data
submitted to the international public sequence databases by 
scientists worldwide.</P>
