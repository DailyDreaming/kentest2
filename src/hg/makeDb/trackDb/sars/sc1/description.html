<P>
The SARS coronavirus TOR2 draft genome assembly 
is based on sequence deposited into GenBank as of 14 April 2003. 

<H3>Sample position queries</H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of an 
mRNA, a coordinate range, a gene identifier, or keywords from 
the GenBank description of an mRNA. The following list shows
examples of valid position queries for the SARS coronavirus TOR2 genome.

<H3>Assembly details</H3>
This browser &mdash; which represents a departure from UCSC's usual focus on vertebrate 
genomes &mdash; shows gene predictions, locations of putative proteins, and 
viral mRNA and protein alignments. Protein structure analysis and 
predictions were determined by using the  
<A HREF="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/research/compbio/sam.html" TARGET=_blank> 
Sequence Alignment and Modeling (SAM) T02</A>
tool. 
<P>
UCSC does not plan to provide a comprehensive set of browsers for viruses.  
However, this browser will be maintained as long as there is strong scientific  
and public interest in the SARS coronavirus TOR2.</P>
<P>
The SARS sequence and annotation data may be downloaded from the UCSC Genome 
Browser <A HREF="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/scApr2003/">FTP server</A> or
<A HREF="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#sars">Downloads</A> web page.
The annotation tracks displayed in the Genome Browser were generated by UCSC and 
collaborators worldwide. See the <A HREF="../goldenPath/credits.html#sars_credits">Credits</A> 
page for a detailed list of the organizations and individuals who contributed 
to the success of this release.
