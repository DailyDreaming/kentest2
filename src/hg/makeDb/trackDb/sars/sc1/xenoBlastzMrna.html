<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The Viral mRNA track shows alignments between viral mRNAs
in GenBank and the SARS genome. </P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track follows the display conventions for 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#PSLDisplay" 
TARGET=_blank>PSL alignment tracks</A>. In dense display mode, the items that
are more darkly shaded indicate matches of better quality. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
GenBank viral mRNAs were aligned against the genome using the 
blastz program. When a single mRNA aligned multiple places, 
the alignment having the highest base identity was found. 
Only those alignments having at least 60% base identity were kept.
These alignments were converted into axt format and the 
resulting axts fed into axtChain. AxtChain organizes all the 
alignments between a single viral mrna and the SARS genome into a group, 
and makes a kd-tree out of all the gapless subsections (blocks) of the 
alignments.  Next, maximally scoring chains of these blocks were found by 
running a dynamic program over the kd-tree. Chains scoring below a 
certain threshold were discarded; the remaining chains are displayed in
this track.</P>

<P>
This track was produced at UCSC from mRNA sequence data
submitted to the international public sequence databases by 
scientists worldwide.</P>
