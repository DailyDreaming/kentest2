<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The $Organism mRNA track shows alignments between viral proteins
in SwissProt and the $Organism draft sequence. Aligning regions (usually exons)
are shown as black boxes connected by lines for gaps (spliced
out introns usually). In full display, arrows on the introns
indicate the direction of transcription.</P>

<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
Swissprot coronavirus proteins are aligned against the $Organism draft sequence using the 
BLAT program (translated alignments). 
These alignments are filtered for alignments greater than 67% (as they usually would be 
for vertebrate genomes) because viruses evolve so quickly and there 
is much greater variance.  </P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
The $Organism viral protein track is produced at UCSC from protein sequence data
submitted to the international public sequence databases by 
scientists worldwide.</P>
