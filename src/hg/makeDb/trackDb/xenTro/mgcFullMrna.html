<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows alignments of <em>$Organism</em> mRNAs from the
<A HREF="https://genecollections.nci.nih.gov/MGC/" TARGET=_blank>Mammalian Gene Collection</A>
(MGC) having full-length open reading frames (ORFs) to the genome.
The goal of the Mammalian Gene Collection is to provide researchers with
unrestricted access to sequence-validated full-length protein-coding cDNA
clones for human, mouse, and rat genes.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The track follows the display conventions for 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay" TARGET=_blank>gene prediction 
tracks</A>.</P>
<P>
An optional codon coloring feature is available for quick
validation and comparison of gene predictions.
To display codon colors, select the <em>genomic codons</em> option from the
<em>Color track by codons</em> pull-down menu. For more information
about this feature, go to the 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgCodonColoring.html" TARGET=_blank>
Coloring Gene Predictions and Annotations by Codon</A> page.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
GenBank <em>$organism</em> MGC mRNAs identified as having full-length ORFs 
were aligned against the genome using blat. When a single mRNA 
aligned in multiple places, the alignment having the highest base identity was
found.  Only alignments having a base identity level within 1% of
the best and at least 95% base identity with the genomic sequence 
were kept.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
The <em>$organism</em> MGC full-length mRNA track was produced at UCSC from 
mRNA sequence data submitted to 
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/" 
TARGET=_blank>GenBank</A> by the Mammalian Gene Collection project.</P>
