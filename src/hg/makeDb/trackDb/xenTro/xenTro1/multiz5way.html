<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows a measure of evolutionary conservation in <em>$Organism</em>, 
chicken, human, mouse, and zebrafish, 
based on a phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phastCons).
Multiz alignments of the following assemblies were used to generate this
annotation: 
<UL>
<LI><em>$Organism</em> $date ($db)
<LI>chicken Feb. 2004 (galGal2)
<LI>human May 2004 (hg17)
<LI>mouse May 2004 (mm5)
<LI>zebrafish Nov. 2003 (danRer1)
</UL></P>
<P>
In full display mode, this track shows the overall conservation score across all
species as well as pairwise alignments of each species aligned to the 
<em>$Organism</em> genome.  The pairwise alignments are
shown in dense display mode using a grayscale 
density gradient.  The checkboxes in the track configuration section allow
the exclusion of species from the pairwise display; however, this does not
remove them from the conservation score display.  </P>
<P>
When zoomed-in to the base-display level, the track shows the base 
composition of each alignment. The numbers and symbols on the Gaps
line indicate the lengths of gaps in the <em>$Organism</em> sequence at those 
alignment positions relative to the longest non-<em>$Organism</em> sequence. 
If there is sufficient space in the display, the size of the gap is shown; 
if not, and if the gap size is a multiple of 3, a &quot;*&quot; is displayed, 
otherwise &quot;+&quot; is shown.  
To view detailed information about the alignments at a specific position,
zoom in the display to 30,000 or fewer bases, then click on the alignment.</P>
<P>
This track may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects
of the displayed information. Click the

configuration help</A> link for an explanation of the configuration options.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P> 
Best-in-genome blastz pairwise alignments 
were multiply aligned using multiz, beginning with <em>$Organism</em>-chicken 
alignments and subsequently adding in human, mouse, and zebrafish.
The resulting multiple alignments were then assigned 
conservation scores by phastCons.</P>
<P>
The phastCons program computes conservation scores based on a phylo-HMM, a
type of probabilistic model that describes both the process of DNA
substitution at each site in a genome and the way this process changes from
one site to the next (Felsenstein and Churchill 1996, Yang 1995, Siepel and
Haussler 2005).  PhastCons uses a two-state phylo-HMM, with a state for
conserved regions and a state for non-conserved regions.  The value plotted
at each site is the posterior probability that the corresponding alignment
column was "generated" by the conserved state of the phylo-HMM.  These
scores reflect the phylogeny (including branch lengths) of the species in
question, a continuous-time Markov model of the nucleotide substitution
process, and a tendency for conservation levels to be autocorrelated along
the genome (i.e., to be similar at adjacent sites).  The general reversible
(REV) substitution model was used.  Note that, unlike many
conservation-scoring programs, phastCons does not rely on a sliding window
of fixed size, so short highly-conserved regions and long moderately
conserved regions can both obtain high scores.  More information about
phastCons can be found in Siepel et al. (2005).</P> 
<P> 
PhastCons currently treats alignment gaps as missing data, which
sometimes has the effect of producing undesirably high conservation scores
in gappy regions of the alignment.  We are looking at several possible ways
of improving the handling of alignment gaps.</P>
