<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.  These gaps - with the
exception of intractable heterochromatic gaps - will be closed during the
finishing process. 
<P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is known, it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap. 
<P>
This assembly was sequenced with paired reads taken from plasmids and
fosmids of various sizes. Overlapping reads were merged into contigs
and pairing information was then used to join the contigs into scaffolds.
The gap sizes (with a minimum gap size of 50) were estimated from the size
of the plasmids and fosmids.
<P>
<P>This assembly contains the following types of gaps:
<UL>
<LI><B>Contig</B> - gaps of size 50 Kb or fewer.
<LI><B>Scaffold</B> - gaps greater than 50 Kb in size. 
</UL>
