<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track is a graph of the density of the chain alignments from Cow bosTau4.
There are some unusual pile-ups between these two genomes.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
A bed file of the chains was made:
<PRE>
$$ zcat susScr2.bosTau4.all.chain.gz | grep "^chain " \
        | awk '{printf "%s\\t%d\\t%d\\t%s\\t%s\\t%s\\n", $$3, $$6, $$7, $$8, $$2, $$5}' \
        &gt; bosTau4.chain.bed
</PRE>
The chain scores were scanned with ave, to find the range of scores:
<PRE>
  ave -col=5 bosTau4.chain.bed
Q1 5300.000000
median 8265.000000
Q3 14079.000000
average 12729.401671
min 3000.000000
max 1506828099.000000
count 144157201
total 1835034915327.000000
standard deviation 419128.061072
</PRE>
The bed file scores were normalized to the range 0-1000 and an
overlap count bedGraph file was calculated, and turned into a bigWig:
<PRE>
$$  awk '
  {printf "%s\\t%d\\t%d\\t%s\\t%d\\t%s\\n", $$1,$$2,$$3,$$4,(1000*$$5)/1506828099, $$6}' \
        bosTau4.chain.bed | sort -k1,1 -k2,2n &gt; bosTau4.chain.normalized.bed
$$  bedItemOverlapCount susScr2 bosTau4.chain.normalized.bed \
    &gt; bosTau4.overlap.wigVar
$$  bedGraphToBigWig bosTau4.overlap.wigVar susScr2.chrom.sizes bosTau4ChainPileUp.bw
$$  bigWigInfo bosTau4ChainPileUp.bw
