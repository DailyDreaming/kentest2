<P>
This track shows the whole genome shotgun (WGS) contigs of the 
November 2003 $organism Zv3 assembly from <A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/Zv3_assembly_information.shtml" TARGET=_blank>The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</A>.
<P>
Following the assembly of sequence to WGS contigs, contigs were mapped to 
scaffolds (supercontigs). A fingerprinted contigs (FPC) map was produced by 
restriction enzyme digestion with HindIII. Clones were selected from this for 
high quality sequencing. To create the Zv3 assembly, the supercontigs were tied 
to this FPC map. 
</P>
<P>
The Zv3 assembly is composed of 62,895 contigs, of which 3,326 are stitched 
contigs. The total stitched contig length is 1.083 gigabases. The assembly 
contains 58,339 supercontigs (scaffolds) having an N50 length of 433.7 kb. Of 
these, a total of 56,849 supercontigs are in the unordered chromosomes:
54,798 in chrFinished, 1842 in chrUn, and 209 in chrNA.

The Zv3 Zebrafish assembly was produced by The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute,
in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, 
the Netherlands Institute for Developmental Biology (Hubrecht Laboratory),
and Yi Zhou, Anthony DiBiase and Leonard Zon from the Boston Children's 
Hospital.
