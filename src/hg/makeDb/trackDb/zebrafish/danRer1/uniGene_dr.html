<H2> Description </H2>
<P>
This track shows alignments of $organism 
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=unigene" 
TARGET= _BLANK>UniGene</A>
sequences to the $organism genome. Sequences are from UniGene Build #78. </P>

<H2> Methods </H2>
<P>
The $organism genome was first masked with RepeatMasker and Tandem Repeats
Finder. The alignments were then made using blat with a minimum sequence 
identity of 95%. Only alignments that met the following criteria are shown 
in this track: a minimum of 20% coverage, at least 96.5% alignment ratio, 
and scores within 0.2% of best-in-genome.  </P>
