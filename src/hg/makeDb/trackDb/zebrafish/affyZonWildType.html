<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows expression data from the <a href="https://zon.tchlab.org/" 
TARGET=_blank">Zon Lab</A> at Children's Hospital Boston using the
<a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/900487"
TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix Zebrafish GeneChip Genome Array</A>. The chip type or 
strain medians associated with replicate experiments (Chip ID display) or 
the average of this data across all strains for each developmental stage 
(Tissue Averages display) can be displayed by selecting the appropriate 
option from the Experiment Display menu on the track description page. For 
more information, see the Track Configuration section.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
For detailed information about the experimental methods, see Weber 
<em>et al.</em> (2005) below. This expression data is for five strains of wild 
type zebrafish whole embryos at different developmental stages. Alignments 
displayed on the track correspond to the target sequences used by Affymetrix 
to choose probes.</P>
<P>
Microarray data were preprocessed using MAS background correction, MAS
probe specific correction, and Loess normalization. Bioconductor's
<A HREF="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/affy.html" TARGET=_blank">affy</A>
package was used to perform this processing. CEL files were normalized as
a single group.  
The track color denotes the signal ratio for a specific 
developmental stage and strain on a log base 2 scale. The ratio is the 
expression value for a probeset divided by the median of expression values 
for that probeset across all experiments. Over-expressed genes are colored red; 
under-expressed genes are show in green. Black indicates that a gene
is neither over- nor under-expressed in the tissue. Uncolored boxes
(white on most browsers) represent missing data. </P>

<P>
Each row on the track or details page shows gene expression data for a 
single developmental stage and a single strain (see Strains and Stages table 
below) from wild type, whole embryo zebrafish. Data was collected by the 
<A HREF="https://www.childrenshospital.org/Research/Labs/zon-laboratory" 
TARGET=_blank>Children&#8217;s Hospital Boston Zebrafish Genome Initiative</A>. 
</P>

<H2>Track Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track may be configured to vary the type of experiment information
shown. It is possible to display all arrays, arrays grouped by       
replicate means, or arrays grouped by replicate medians.  Choose the 
desired set of arrays from the <B>Combine arrays</B> list above.
To display all arrays for each strain and developmental stage, select    
<EM>All Arrays</EM> from the list. The default display shows the Replicate
Medians.
