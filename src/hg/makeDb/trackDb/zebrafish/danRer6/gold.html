<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the Zebrafish Zv8 (Dec. 2008) assembly provided by 
<A HREF="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/zebrafish/genomeproject.html"
TARGET=_blank>The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</A>. 
It contains scaffolds (supercontigs) totaling 1,481,241,295 bp. 
The assembly has been tied to the fingerprint contig (FPC) map 
(data freeze December 12, 2008), which provides a tiling path of sequenced clones.
1.48 Gb of sequence from 9,816 sequenced clones (8,276 finished and 1,090 
unfinished) were used as a scaffold for the assembly. Gaps were filled with 
contigs from a whole genome shotgun (WGS) assembly of 6.5-7x coverage comprised
of reads from a library created from a single Tuebingen doubled haploid 
zebrafish. Approximately 1.32 Gbp (89%) of the resulting integrated assembly 
were placed on chromosomes 1-25, including estimated gap sizes and 100 bp gaps 
inserted betweeen scaffolds. The complete sequence of the mitochondrion genome,
which is shown as chrM in the Genome Browser, was obtained from GenBank.  </P>
<P>
The entire assembly consists of chrM, 25 chromosomes, and 
11,598 unplaced scaffolds that fall into three groups:
<UL>
<LI><B>Zv8_scaffold100.1</B> - sequences based on FPC contigs or linked to 
chromosomes via a marker (30,890 contigs in 180 unmapped scaffolds)
where scaffold100 is the scaffold identifier,
.1 represents the contig number within the scaffold.
Contig numbers start at 1 and continue for each contig that is part of the same scaffold.
<LI><B>Zv8_NA10001.1</B> - WGS contigs that could not be related to any FPC contig 
and could not be be placed on a chromosome (28628 contigs in 11,418 unmapped scaffolds)
where NA10001 is the scaffold identifier,
.1 represents the contig number within the scaffold.
Contig numbers start at 1 and continue for each contig that is part of the same scaffold.
<LI><B>CU862018.4_00005</B> - Unfinished WGS contigs parts whose exact
order and orientation may not be correct (5628 unmapped contig parts).
CU862018 is the contig identifier,
.4 represents the version of the contig, 
and 00005 represents the tentative position of the contig part
within the unfinished contig.
</UL>
The unplaced scaffolds contain 100 bp gaps that are shown in the 
Gap annotation. 
<P>
All components within this track are of fragment type &quot;W&quot;
(WGS contig) except for chrM, which is type &quot;F&quot; (Finished).
<P>
In dense mode, this track depicts the path through the draft and
finished clones (aka the golden path) used to create the assembled sequence.
Clone boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown
coloration. Where gaps exist in the path, spaces are shown between the gold 
and brown blocks.  If the relative order and orientation of the scaffolds
between the two blocks is known, a line is drawn to bridge the
blocks.</P>
