<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps in the $organism assembly.  These gaps - with the
exception of intractable heterochromatic gaps - will be closed during the
finishing process.
</P><P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is known, it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap. 
</P>
<P>This assembly contains only one type of gap: contig gaps. These are gaps of 
5000 bp between the scaffolds (&quot;super-contigs&quot;) constructed from the 
whole genome shotgun (WGS) contigs. 
On the virtual chromosomes containing scaffolds that could not be 
confidently placed on a chromosome (e.g. chrUn and chrNA), 1000 bp gaps have 
been inserted between scaffolds.
