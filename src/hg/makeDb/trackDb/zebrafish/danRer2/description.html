The June 2004 zebrafish (<em>Danio rerio</em>) Zv4 assembly was produced by 
The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in collaboration with the Max Planck 
Institute for Developmental Biology in Tuebingen, Germany, and the Netherlands
Institute for Developmental Biology (Hubrecht Laboratory), Utrecht, The 
Netherlands. 

<H3>Sample position queries</P></H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of
an mRNA or EST, a scaffold range, an Ensembl transcript ID, or keywords from 
the GenBank description of an mRNA. The following list provides 
examples of various types of position queries for the zebrafish genome. Note 
that some position queries (e.g. "huntington") may return matches to the mRNA 
records of other species. In these cases, the mRNAs are mapped to their 
homologs in zebrafish.  See the 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html" TARGET=_blank>User Guide</A> for more help.

<H3>Assembly details</H3>
<P>
The Zv4 assembly consists of 1,560,480,686 bp in 21,333 scaffolds with a 
sequence coverage of approximately 5.7x. 443 Mb of the assembly is from 
2,828 finished clones and 121 Mb is from 1,272 unfinished clones. 
<P>
This assembly was constructed using two different strategies. In the first, 
a whole genome shotgun (WGS) approach was used.  DNA from 1000 five-day-old 
Tuebingen embryos was used to generate plasmid and fosmid libraries. The 
libraries were sequenced and the resulting traces were assembled with the 
Sanger Institute assembler, Phusion. The second approach used traditional 
clone mapping and sequencing techniques to produce a higher quality genome 
sequence. BAC libraries were selected and fingerprinted to generate a 
fingerprint contig (FPC) map. From this map, a tiling path was calculated 
that covered the genome sequence clone-by-clone. Clones from this path were 
selected for high quality sequencing and then pieced together to form the 
genome sequence. 
<P>
75% of the sequence (1,260,930,206 bp) was tied to the FPC map, which 
provided a template for placing the unfinished sequence. The remaining 
sequence was filled with WGS contigs using a combination of sequence 
alignment and BAC end positions. The WGS contigs used in this assembly were 
identical to those used for the Zv3 assembly, but the FPC data and its 
integration with the WGS data has been considerably improved. 
<P>
The Sanger Institute notes there is high level of misassembly present in 
this release due to the large amount of polymorphism in the DNA source. 
Highly variable regions within the genome posed assembly difficulties, most 
likely because the sequences originated from different haplotypes.
