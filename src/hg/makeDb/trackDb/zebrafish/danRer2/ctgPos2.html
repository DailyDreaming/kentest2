<P>
This track shows the whole genome shotgun (WGS) contigs of the June 2004 
$organism Zv4 assembly from <A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/Zv4_assembly_information.shtml" TARGET=_blank>The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</A>.
<P>
Following the assembly of sequence to WGS contigs, contigs were mapped to 
scaffolds (supercontigs). A fingerprinted contigs (FPC) map was produced by 
restriction enzyme digestion with HindIII. Clones were selected from this for 
high quality sequencing. To create the Zv4 assembly, the scaffolds were tied 
to this FPC map. The chrFinished scaffolds from the Zv3 assembly (danRer1) have now be placed on chromosomes.

<P>
The assembly contains 21,333 scaffolds having an N50 length of 719.2 kb. Of 
these, a total of 19,441 scaffolds are in the unordered chromosomes: 
694 in chrUn, and 18,747 in chrNA.

The Zv4 Zebrafish assembly was produced by The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute,
in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, 
the Netherlands Institute for Developmental Biology (Hubrecht Laboratory),
and Yi Zhou, Anthony DiBiase and Leonard Zon from the Boston Children's 
Hospital.
