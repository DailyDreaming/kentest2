<H3>Sample position queries</H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of a
sequenced genomic region, an mRNA or EST, a chromosomal coordinate
range, or keywords from the GenBank description of an mRNA. The
following list shows examples of valid position queries for the
zebrafish genome.  Note that some position queries (e.g. "huntington") may 
return matches to the mRNA records of other species. In these cases, the 
mRNAs are mapped to their homologs in zebrafish. See the
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html"
    TARGET=_blank>User's Guide</A> for more information.

<H3>Assembly details</H3>
<P>
The Zv7 assembly consists of 1,440,582,308 bp in 5,036 fragments 
(N50 = 1,153,933, n = 277). 
This assembly was constructed using two different strategies. 
One approach used traditional clone mapping and sequencing techniques to 
produce a higher-quality genome sequence. BAC libraries were selected and 
fingerprinted to generate a fingerprint contig (FPC) map (data freeze 11 April
2007). From this map, 
a tiling path was calculated that covered the genome sequence clone-by-clone. 
Clones from this path were selected for high-quality sequencing and then 
pieced together to form the genome sequence. The other strategy involved a whole
genome shotgun (WGS) approach.
The WGS assembly, of lower quality sequence, was used to fill gaps in 
the tiling path. It was generated using 13,756,367 reads from a single
Tuebingen doubled haploid zebrafish. The reads comprised 10,891,216,277 bp 
and were clustered using Phusion, resulting in a coverage of 5.5x.</P>
<P>
Clone sequences and WGS contigs were integrated by considering sequence 
alignments, BAC end placements and zebrafish cDNAs and markers. Improvements 
to the integration algorithm allowed the placement of the WGS contigs that 
contained markers, but could not be linked to the FPC contigs. In cases where 
markers from different chromosomes appeared on the same contig, priority was 
given to the Heat Shock Diploid Cross Panel (HS) and the Boston MGH Cross 
Map (MGH). Some of these discrepancies may be attributed to misassemblies, but 
there may also be inconsistencies between the zebrafish marker panels. </P>
<P>
The integrated assembly contains 1.02 Gb from 7,823 sequenced clones, 
(7,139 finished and 684 unfinished).  
89% of the sequence -- 1,277,075,233 bp including estimated gap sizes and
100 bp gaps between scaffolds -- lies in scaffolds that are placed on 
chromosomes 1-25 (linkage groups 1-25) after integration of the WGS 
assembly with the clone sequences. Integration was 
achieved by considering a combination of sequence alignment and BAC end 
positions, as well as features such as zebrafish cDNAs and markers. 
45,800,611 bp of the sequence are in 166 scaffolds tied to unplaced 
FPC contigs; 117,689,868 bp are in 4,844 NA scaffolds, which are unplaced WGS 
contigs. 
The zebrafish mitochondrial sequence is also
available as the virtual chromosome &quot;chrM&quot;.</P>
<P>
The Sanger Institute notes this assembly release is still preliminary. 
Highly variable regions within the genome posed assembly difficulties, 
most likely because the sequences originated from different haplotypes. 
This also results in assembly dropouts and false duplications. 
While generating this assembly, special attention was paid to such issues and 
more than 200 Mb of duplicated sequence was removed in comparison to the Zv6
assembly (UCSC danRer4).
