<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows alignments between $organism T51 radiation hybrid (RH) map 
sequences, consisting of ESTs and other genetic markers, and the genome. Many 
of these markers are not genetically polymorphic and therefore cannot be 
placed on genetic maps. The markers with RH map positions are useful for 
locating genes lying in genomic regions with mutations and in the 
positional cloning of zebrafish genetic mutants that exhibit interesting 
phenotypes. </P>
<P>
This track shows alignments for 11514 RH map sequences (October 3, 2006 
update) that consist of:
<UL> 
<LI>5265 markers mapped by Dr. Robert Geisler at the

(MPI) for Developmental Biology</A>, Germany (Max-Planck-Institut fur 
Entwicklungsbiologie or MPIEB).

The linkage group number is equivalent to the chromosome number for zebrafish. 
Position, which is relative to the top of the linkage group, is the marker 
number used by the SAMapper software. Marker types can be BAC_END, EST, GENE, 
SSLP or STS. The markers are from the following sources:
<P>
<UL> 
<LI>BACENDS - end sequences of fingerprinted BAC clones.
<LI>CUSTOM - various markers and genes sent from outside labs to CHBG for 
mapping.
<LI>INSERTMUT - genomic sites where retroviral insertions occurred in 
insertional mutants.
<LI>MGH - SSLP markers from the lab of Dr. Mark Fishman at Massachusetts
General Hospital.
<LI>NCBI - marker primer or parent sequences retrieved from the NCBI 
databases.
<LI>OTHER_ZFEST - zebrafish ESTs generated elsewhere other than the 
<A HREF="http://zfish.wustl.edu/" TARGET=_blank>Washington 
University Genome Center at St. Louis</A>.
<LI>SEQPROJ - contig or scaffold from the zebrafish genome sequencing 
project at <A HREF="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/data/zebrafish-genome-project"
TARGET=_blank>The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</A>.
<LI>SHOTGUN - random shotgun sequences from
<A HREF="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/data/zebrafish-genome-project" TARGET="_blank">
The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</A>.
<LI>THISSE - cDNAs that have specific expression patterns found by 
<I>in situ</I> hybridization and provided from the lab of Drs. Bernard and
Christine Thisse at the <A HREF="http://www.igbmc.fr/"
TARGET=_blank>Institute of Genetics and Molecular and Cellular Biology</A>.
<LI>WU_ZFEST - individual ESTs and EST assemblies from the 
Washington University Genome Center at St. Louis.
<LI>WZ - EST assemblies from the Washington University Genome Center at
St. Louis.

The majority of these sequences are single-read sequences 
in the range of about 40 - 1300 bp. The ESTs usually
represent fragments of transcribed genes.  

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track follows the display conventions for 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#PSLDisplay" 
TARGET=_blank>PSL alignment tracks</A>. 
The strand information (+/-) indicates the
direction of the match between the EST and the matching
genomic sequence.  It bears no relationship to the direction
of transcription of the RNA with which it might be associated.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
To generate this track, $organism RH map sequences were aligned against the 
genome using blat. Only alignments with a base identity level within 0.1% of 
the best and at least 80% base identity with the genomic sequence were kept. 
The following pslReps parameters were used: <em>-nearTop=0.0001 -minAli=0.80
-minCover=0.20</em>. </P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
The $organism RH Map track was produced by UCSC in collaboration with the 
Zebrafish Genome Project Initiative at Childrens Hospital, Boston, from 
sequence data obtained from the individuals and institutions mentioned in the 
Description section. </P>
