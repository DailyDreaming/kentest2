<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows the Zebrafish Zv6 (March 2006) assembly 
provided by 
<A HREF="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/data/zebrafish-genome-project"
TARGET=_blank>The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</A>. 
The assembly has a sequence coverage of about 6.5-7X and contains 6,653 
scaffolds (supercontigs) totaling 1.6 billion base pairs. A tiling path of 
sequenced clones is provided by the Fingerprinted Contig (FPC) map (data 
Freeze 12th March 2006). The Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) assembly that was 
used to fill the gaps in the tiling path is the same as that used for the 
Zv5 assembly. 18,969,500 (92%) of the 20,541,433 WGS reads were placed in the 
assembly. This set of reads includes 6,882,050 from a new library that was 
generated from a single Tuebingen, doubled haploid fish.
</P>
<P>In dense mode, this track depicts the path through the draft and
finished clones (aka the golden path) used to create the assembled sequence.
Clone boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown
coloration. Where gaps
exist in the path, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  If the relative order and orientation of the contigs
between the two blocks is known, a line is drawn to bridge the
blocks.</P>
<P>
The Genome Browser depicts the zebrafish genome as 25 chromosomes consisting of
whole genome shotgun (WGS) supercontigs that were mapped to a fingerprinted
contig (FPC) and were from a known chromosome. There are also 2 unordered 
virtual chromosomes: 
<UL>
<LI><B>chrNA_random</B> - WGS contigs that could not be related to any 
FPC contig
<LI><B>chrUn_random</B> - WGS supercontigs that mapped to FPC contigs, but the 
chromosome is unknown
</UL>
The virtual chromosomes contain 500 bp 
scaffold gaps that are shown in the Gap track annotation. All the unplaced
scaffolds from chrFinished (in assembly Zv3, danRer1) have been mapped to the
chromosomes since the Zv4 assembly (danRer2).
<P>
All components within this track are of fragment type &quot;W&quot;
(WGS contig) except for chrM which is type &quot;F&quot; (Finished).

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
This assembly was constructed using the assembler, Phusion, to cluster reads. 
Phrap was then used for cluster assembly and consensus generation. Supercontigs or scaffolds were created from contigs joined together based on read-pair
information where the sizes of gaps were estimated by using insert sizes of
different lengths. For the clone-based mapping and finishing, clones from 
different libraries were fingerprinted by digestion with the HindIII 
restriction enzyme.  From the information produced in this way, overlapping 
clones were linked into FPCs. Next, clones from a tiling path through the FPC 
contigs were selected for high quality sequencing. The resulting 
sequence was submitted to EMBL/GenBank. Clone sequences and WGS contigs were
integrated by considering sequence alignments, BAC end placements and 
zebrafish cDNAs and markers. Improvements to the integration algorithm allowed 
the placement of the WGS contigs that contained markers but could not be linked to the FPC contigs. In cases where markers from different chromosomes appear 
on the same contig, priority has been given to the Heat Shock Diploid Cross
Panel (HS) and the Boston MGH Cross Map (MGH). Some of these discrepancies
are due to misassemblies but there may also be inconsistencies between the 
zebrafish marker panels.  
<P>
The supercontigs tied to the FPC map create the assembly shown in this track. 
1.547 Gigabases or 95% of the sequence could be tied to the FPC map. The 
finished clone sequence was then analyzed via a pipeline that included 
repeatmasking, <em>ab initio</em> gene prediction and blast searches against 
all protein, EST and cDNA sequences that were available. Results from this 
analysis were used to manually annotate clones with gene structures, 
descriptions and poly-A features. At this point, the clone was submitted to 
EMBL/GenBank again and can be browsed in
