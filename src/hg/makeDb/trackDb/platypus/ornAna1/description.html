<H3>Assembly details</H3>
<P>
The following assembly information is taken from the v5.0.1 release notes:</P>
<P>
The platypus (<em>Ornithorhynchus anatinus</em>) genome of a female nicknamed
&quot;Glennie&quot; (collected at the Upper Barnard River on Glen Rock Station,
New South Wales) was sequenced to a total of 6x whole genome coverage.
The sequencing strategy utilized combined whole genome shotgun
plasmid, fosmid and BAC end sequences.  The combined sequence reads
were assembled using the PCAP software (<A 
HREF="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/13/9/2164.long"
TARGET=_BLANK>Huang, <em>et al.</em>,
2003</A>) using stringent parameters. After initial assembly with the PCAP
software, supercontigs (ordered/oriented contigs; contigs are
contiguous sequences not interrupted by gaps) were linked to the
physical map (Washington University Genome Sequencing Center) using
BAC end sequences and in silico digests of the sequence itself. The
physical map, then, was used to organize the supercontigs into
"ultracontigs" (ordered/oriented supercontigs).  With the exception of
those supercontigs with alignments at &gt;95% identity to a platypus
EST (Washington University Genome Sequencing Center), supercontigs smaller
than 2 kb were removed from the data set prior to submission if they
were &gt;97% identical over &gt;97% of their length to other ultracontigs
larger than 2 kb or if they were deemed to be &gt;95% repetitive (based on
analysis using RECON (<A 
HREF="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/12/8/1269.long"
TARGET=_BLANK>Bao and Eddy, 2002</A>) for repeat
identification). Further, singleton contigs (those not part of a
supercontig or ultracontig) smaller than 500 bp that did not have
an alignment of &gt;95% identity to a platypus EST were not submitted.
</P>
<P>
The assembly is composed of 205,536 supercontigs 
(based on the physical map, 4,197 supercontigs were organized into 689
ultracontigs; the remaining 218 ultracontigs (composed of 595 contigs)
were formed based solely on alignments with platypus EST data)
covering 1.84 Gb of actual sequence (without including estimated gap
sizes) or almost 2.0 Gb including gap sizes. Of the 1.84 Gb, 437 Mb (1507
supercontigs organized into 145 ultracontigs) have been anchored and
ordered along platypus chromosomes using the physical map in
combination with FISH data. The N50 statistic is defined as the length
L such that 50% of all nucleotides are contained in contigs of size at
least L.  The N50 number is 298 and the N50 size is 967 kb.
</P>
<P>
Future improvements to the platypus sequence assembly will be
dependent on the availability of funding and improvements to existing
assembler software. Funding for the sequencing of the platypus genome
was provided by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI),
National Institutes of Health (NIH).
