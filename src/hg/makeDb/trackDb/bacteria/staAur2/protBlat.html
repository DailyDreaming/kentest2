<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows the <em>blat</em> alignment of protein sequences
from other strains to this reference sequence: ASM1346v1/USA300_FPR3757.
It shows the alignments of the protein sequences of each of the other
strains mapped against this reference strain.  The results are separated
into different tracks, based on the percent match to the reference.
A click into any item gives access to the pairwise alignment between
the selected strain and the reference.
</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
The <em>blat</em> procedure was operated via the <em>gfServer/gfClient</em>
system where the <em>gfServer</em> service was started:
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp; gfServer start &lt;serverName&gt; 17897 -stepSize=5 staAur2.2bit
</pre>
and
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp; gfServer start &lt;serverName&gt; 17896 -trans -mask staAur2.2bit
</pre>
And the <em>gfClient</em> command is directed to the <em>translated</em>
server, and is operated simply:
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp; gfClient -t=dnax -q=prot &lt;serverName&gt; 17896 . &lt;query.faa&gt; &lt;result.psl&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The other strain protein sequences are obtained from their NCBI RefSeq
release as supplied in the release <em>.gff.gz</em> file.
