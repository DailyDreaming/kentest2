"This sequence version makes minor modifications to the original Cb1
(cb25.agp8) sequence assembly and uses a genetic map to align the
contigs along chromosomes.  The Cb1 assembly was produced for the
<em>C. briggsae</em> strain AF16 from 2.05 million whole genome shotgun (WGS)
reads, of which 88.2% were in read pairs. The sequence reads were
generated at Washington University School of Medicine's Genome
Sequencing Center and the Sanger Centre (Hinxton, UK).  The Phusion
(Mullikin, J) assembler was used to assemble the WGS reads into
contigs based on overlap information, and then into supercontigs using
read pair information to cross gaps. These supercontigs were assembled
into mapped ultracontigs based on FPC fingerprint mapping (generated
at Washington University School of Medicine's Genome Sequencing
Center), with material from previously finished clones used to bridge
gaps. Using the sequence data to identify SNPs between AF16 and HK104
and to distribute primers along major ultracontigs, a genetic map (Ray
Miller, Washington University School of Medicine) was constructed
using recombinant inbred lines (Scott E. Baird, Wright State
University) which yielded 6 chromosomes.  The genetic mapping data
along with underlying read pairing data were used to break several
misassemblies in ultracontigs and to order and orient the sequences
along the <em>C. briggsae</em> chromosomes to create the Cb3 release."

<P>
In dense mode, this track depicts the ultracontigs that make up the 
currently viewed chromosome.  Ultracontig boundaries are distinguished by
the use of alternating gold and brown coloration. There are 100 base
gaps between ultracontigs.
