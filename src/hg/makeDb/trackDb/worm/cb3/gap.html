<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.

<P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
All these gaps are arbitrary 100 base pair gaps between ultracontigs.
The relative order and orientation of the ultracontigs is not known
on this artifical chrUn assembly.  None of these gaps are bridged.
</P>
<P>This assembly contains the following principal types of gaps:
<UL>

<LI><B>clone</B> - gaps between the Whole Genome Shotgun ultracontigs
<LI><B>contig</B> - gaps between the Whole Genome Shotgun ultracontigs

</UL></P>
