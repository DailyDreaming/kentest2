<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The WS Genes track shows Sanger Gene predictions from the
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/wormbase/WS190/"
TARGET=_blank>Wormbase v. WS190 files</A> downloaded from the Sanger Institute 
FTP site, and then mapped onto the WS180 genome assembly. 
This track shows the subset of data annotated as
&quot;curated&quot;, or &quot;Coding_transcript&quot; followed by one of 
these strings: &quot;intron&quot;, &quot;coding_exon&quot;, &quot;exon&quot;,
&quot;cds&quot;, &quot;three_prime_UTR&quot;, or &quot;five_prime_UTR&quot;
in the gff files.
