<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.

<P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is supported by read pair data, 
it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap. 
</P>
<P>This assembly contains the following two types of gaps:
<UL>

<LI><B>fragment</B> - gaps between the Whole Genome Shotgun contigs of a 
supercontig/scaffold.  (In this context, a contig is a set of
overlapping sequence reads.  
A supercontig/scaffold is a set of contigs ordered and oriented during the 
Whole Genome Shotgun process using paired-end reads.)
These are represented by varying numbers of <em>N</em>s  in the assembly.  
Fragment gap sizes are usually taken from read pair data.  
<LI><B>scaffold</B> - gaps between supercontigs not linked by the fingerprint 
map.  These are represented by 1,000 <em>N</em>s in the assembly of
the artifical chromosome chrUn (concatenation of unplaced supercontigs).

As described at WormBase: "This is a 20X inbred (one gravid female per generation) derivative of LKC28, which is conspecific with CB5161."  Recently renamed
to <em>C. brenneri</em>.  Other conspecific strains: SB129, SB280.  See also:
