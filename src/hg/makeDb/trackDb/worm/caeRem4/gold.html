"The <em>Caenorhabditis remanei</em> genome was sequenced to a depth of 9.2X using
using plasmid and fosmid libraries made from DNA extracted from a
mixed population of females and males from all developmental stages.
Coverage was based on an expected genome size of 130 Mb. The whole-genome
shotgun plasmid and fosmid paired-end reads were assembled using PCAP
(Huang, X. <em>et al.</em> 2003).  The sequence can be downloaded
from the <A HREF="ftp://genome.wustl.edu/pub/organism/Invertebrates/Caenorhabditis_remanei/assembly/Caenorhabditis_remanei-15.0.1/output"

The UCSC Genome browser displays the 3,670 supercontigs from the WS220 release.
There are 138,406,203 base pairs of sequence with 10,705,348 Ns in gaps.

<P>
In dense mode this track depicts the supercontigs with constituent contigs.
Contig boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration.  All unknown sequences indicated by nucleotides of <em>N</em>
have been marked as gaps.

All components within this track are of fragment type &quot;W&quot;: 
Whole Genome Shotgun contig. </P>
