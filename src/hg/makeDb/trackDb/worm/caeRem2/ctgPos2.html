Quote from <A HREF="https://www.genome.wustl.edu/" TARGET=_blank>genome.wustl.edu</A>:
"The Caenorhabditis remanei genome was sequenced to a depth of 9X using
whole-genome shotgun plasmid and fosmid libraries made from DNA extracted
from a mixture of larvae and adult males and females. Coverage was based
on an expected genome size of 100 Mb. The whole-genome shotgun plasmid
and fosmid paired end reads were assembled using PCAP
(Huang, X. <em>et al.</em> 2003) and submitted to GenBank under the
accession number AAGD00000000."

The UCSC Genome browser displays the 9,660 scaffolds as a single
artifical chromosome chrUn. There is 161,944,676 bases of sequence
and 15,046,237 N's in gaps.
