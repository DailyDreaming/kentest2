<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the draft assembly of the $organism genome.  

Quote from <A HREF="https://www.genome.wustl.edu/" TARGET=_blank>genome.wustl.edu</A>:
"The Caenorhabditis remanei genome was sequenced to a depth of 9X using
whole-genome shotgun plasmid and fosmid libraries made from DNA extracted
from a mixture of larvae and adult males and females. Coverage was based
on an expected genome size of 100 Mb. The whole-genome shotgun plasmid
and fosmid paired end reads were assembled using PCAP
(Huang, X. <em>et al.</em> 2003) and submitted to GenBank under the
accession number AAGD00000000."

The UCSC Genome browser displays the 9,660 scaffolds as a single
artifical chromosome chrUn. There are 161,944,676 bases of sequence
and 15,046,237 Ns in gaps.

In dense mode, this track depicts the supercontigs.  Supercontig boundaries
are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Arbitrary 1000 base gaps exist between the supercontigs, shown as
spaces between the gold and brown blocks.

All components within this track are of fragment type &quot;W&quot;: 
Whole Genome Shotgun contig. </P>
