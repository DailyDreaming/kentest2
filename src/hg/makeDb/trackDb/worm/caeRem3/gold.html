"The <em>Caenorhabditis remanei</em> genome was sequenced to a depth of 9.2X using
using plasmid and fosmid libraries made from DNA extracted from a
mixed population of females and males from all developmental stages.
Coverage was based on an expected genome size of 130 Mb. The whole-genome
shotgun plasmid and fosmid paired-end reads were assembled using PCAP
(Huang, X. <em>et al.</em> 2003).  </P>
<P>
The UCSC Genome browser displays the 3,670 scaffolds as a single
artifical chromosome, chrUn. There are 138,406,203 base pairs of sequence
with 10,705,348 Ns in gaps.
</P>
<P>
In dense mode this track depicts the supercontigs.  Supercontig boundaries
are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Arbitrary 1000 base pair gaps exist between the supercontigs, shown as
spaces between the gold and brown blocks.

<P>
All components within this track are of fragment type &quot;W&quot;: 
Whole Genome Shotgun contig. </P>
