This genome has been sequenced to 8.92X coverage.  There are 13,962 contigs
comprising 133,635,077 bases (304 undetermined bases marked as N nucleotides
in the sequence).  The largest contig, ABKE01000001 is 156,897 bases.
One half of the sequence, 66,817,538 bases, is contained in 2135 contigs,
all of at least 18,623 bases (N50).
</P>
<P>
In dense mode, this track depicts the contigs.  Contig boundaries
are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration.
</P>
<P>
All components within this track are of fragment type &quot;D&quot;: 
Whole Genome Shotgun draft contig. </P>
