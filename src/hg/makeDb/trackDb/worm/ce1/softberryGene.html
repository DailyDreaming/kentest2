<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Gene predictions on $date release of <em>$organism</em> sequences.
Fgenesh++ predictions are based on Softberry's gene finding software. 
The set of 19112 genes includes 4682 genes corresponding to known mRNAs, 
13085 having similarity with proteins from NR database, and 
1345 <em>ab initio</em> predictions.</P>

<A HREF="http://www.softberry.com/berry.phtml?topic=fgenesh&group=help&subgroup=gfind"
TARGET=_blank>Fgenesh++</A> uses both hidden Markov models (HMMs) and 
protein similarity to find genes in a completely automated manner. For more 
information, see Solovyev, V.V. (2001) in the References section below.</P>
