<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the contigs used to assemble the supercontigs
in the draft assembly of the $organism genome.  
</P>
<P>
The assembly is 9.5X WGS coverage. The 3,510 supercontigs are displayed
in the UCSC Genome browser as a single artifical chromosome chrUn with an
artifical gap of 1,000 N's between supercontigs. The largest supercontig
is 4,147,112 base pairs with 121 supercontigs larger than 377,562 base pairs (N50) containing
over 50% of the sequence.
