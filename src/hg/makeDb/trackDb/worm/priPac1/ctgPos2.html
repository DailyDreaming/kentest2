<P>
This track shows the contigs used to assemble the supercontigs
in the draft assembly of the $organism genome.  
</P>
<P>
The genome has been sequenced to 8.92X coverage. There are 5,106 scaffolds
comprising 169,747,139 bases, constructed from 18,752 contigs comprising
145,948,246 bases. The UCSC browser displays the 5,106 scaffolds as a
single artifical chromosome chrUn of size 174,852,139 bases with an
artifical gap of 1000 between each scaffold. The largest
scaffold (Contig0) is 2,658,817 bases. One half of the sequence,
84,873,569 bases, is contained in 64 scaffolds, all at least 823,357
bases (N50).
