<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays blastz alignments of the <em>$o_organism</em> assembly ($o_db,
$o_date) to the <em>$organism</em> genome. The track has an optional 
feature that color codes alignments to indicate the chromosomes from which 
they are derived in the aligning assembly. To activate the color feature, 
click the <em>on</em> button next to &quot;Color track based on
chromosome&quot; on the track description page.</P>

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>
This track has a filter that can be used to change the display mode,
turn on the chromosome color track, or filter the display output by
chromosome. The filter is located at the top of the track description page,
which is accessed via the small button to the left of the track's graphical
display or through the link on the track's control menu.
<UL>
<LI><B>Color track</B>: To display the chromosome color track, click the
<em>on</em> button next to &quot;Color track based on chromosome&quot;.
When the color track is activated, each of the items within the annotation
track will be colored to show the chromosome in the aligning genome
assembly from which the alignment originated.
<LI><B>Chromosome filter</B>: To display only alignments from a specific
chromomsome in the aligning assembly, type the chromosome number (in the
form <I>chrN</I>) in the text box to the right of &quot;Filter by
chromosome&quot;. For example, to display alignments from chromosome 6,
type &quot;chr6&quot;.
</UL>
<P>
When you have finished configuring the filter, click the <I>Submit</I>
button.</P>
