A genome position can be specified by the accession number of a
sequenced genomic region, an mRNA, a chromosome (or scaffold) coordinate
range, or keywords from the GenBank description of an mRNA. The
following list shows examples of valid position queries for the
<em>S. purpuratus</em> genome.  See the

<H3>Assembly details</H3>
<P>
The Sep. 2006 release of the purple sea urchin genome (<em>Strongylocentrotus 
purpuratus</em>) is now available in the UCSC Genome Browser. This assembly, 
UCSC version strPur2, was produced by the Baylor College of Medicine Human 
Genome Sequencing Center (BCM HGSC) and corresponds to their Spur_2.1 assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The Spur_2.1 release was assembled from BAC sequence reads (approximately 2x 
coverage) and whole genome shotgun reads (6x coverage), and utilizes BAC tiling 
path information. The BCM HGSC Atlas-2.0 genome assembly system was used to 
generate this assembly. 
The total length of all contigs greater than 1 kb is 804 Mbps.  When the 
gaps between contigs in scaffolds are included, the total span of the 
assembly is 907 Mbps.  The estimated size of the genome based on the 
assembly is 814 Mbps.</P>
<P>
Compared to previous sea urchin releases, the Spur_2.1 
assembly is more continuous and has fewer false duplications; contaminations 
identified in the previous Spur_2.0 assembly have been removed. This draft 
assembly may contain errors; therefore, users should exercise caution. Typical 
errors may include misassemblies of repeat sequences, collapses of repeat 
regions, and artificial duplications in polymorphic regions. However, base 
accuracy in contigs is usually very high with most errors near the ends of 
contigs. </P>
