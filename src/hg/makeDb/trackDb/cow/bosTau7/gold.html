<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows the draft assembly (Oct. 2011, Btau_4.6.1 (NCBI project 12555,
accession GCA_000003205.4)) of the $organism genome provided by the Bovine Genome
Sequencing Consortium. Whole-genome shotgun reads were assembled into contigs and
when possible, contigs were grouped into scaffolds (also known as &quot;supercontigs&quot;).
The order, orientation and gap sizes between contigs within a scaffold are based on
paired-end read evidence.
</p>

<p>
In dense mode, this track depicts the contigs that make up the currently viewed
scaffold. Contig boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown
coloration. Where gaps exist between contigs, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  The relative order and orientation of the contigs within a scaffold are always
known; therefore, a line is drawn in the graphical display to bridge the blocks.
