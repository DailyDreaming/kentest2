<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the scaffolds of the assembled chromosomes included
in Btau_3.1 draft assembly of the $Organism genome, produced by the
Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center.  
The sequencing strategy combined BAC shotgun reads with whole genome
shotgun reads from small insert libraries as well as BAC end
sequences.  
For detailed information on the sequencing and assembly techniques,

UCSC displays the unplaced chrUn.* scaffolds separately, so this track 
is not necessary in chrUn.*.  It is displayed in the assembled chromosomes
(chr1-29, chrX) only.
