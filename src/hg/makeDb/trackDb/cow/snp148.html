<H2>Description</H2>

<P>
This track contains information about single nucleotide polymorphisms
and small insertions and deletions (indels) &mdash; collectively Simple
Nucleotide Polymorphisms &mdash; from
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/" target=_blank>dbSNP</A>
build 148, available from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms" target=_blank>ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp</A>. 
A subset of the items in this track are contained in Mult. SNPs(148), 
which are SNPs that have been mapped to multiple locations in the 
reference genome assembly.
</P>
<P>
The default maximum <A HREF="#Weight">weight</A> for this track is 1, so unless
the setting is changed in the track controls, SNPs that map to multiple genomic
locations will be omitted from display.  When a SNP's flanking sequences
map to multiple locations in the reference genome, it calls into question
whether there is true variation at those sites, or whether the sequences
at those sites are merely highly similar but not identical.
</P>
