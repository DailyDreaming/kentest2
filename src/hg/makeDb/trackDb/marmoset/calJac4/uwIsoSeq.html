<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
  These tracks show the Iso-Seq long read alignments of marmoset cDNAs to the
  genome. The data set consists eleven tissue samples from two individuals.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Generation of Full Length cDNA and Library Preparation for Sequencing
    <p>
      Full-length cDNA was prepared and sequenced from total RNA isolated from various tissues of both a two year old male and a two year old female Callithrix jacchus. Iso-Seq library production was performed as per the Iso-Seq Express protocol (https://www.pacb.com/wp-content/uploads/Procedure-Checklist-IsoSeq-Express-Template-Preparation-for-Sequel-and-Sequel-II-Systems.pdf) and barcoded using barcoded adapters.  One library was generated for each tissue.
    </p>
  <li>Sequencing with the PacBio Sequel II Platform
    <p>
      Libraries were pooled equimolar and sequenced on 3 SMRT Cell 8M on the Sequel II platform with chemistry version 2EA. 
    </p>
  <li>Data Processing
    <p>
      Collected data was demultiplexed with lima (demultiplex barcoding), then analyzed with CCS with a requirement of 1 minimum pass and at least 0.9 identity (--minPasses 1 --min-rq 0.9). The Iso-Seq analysis pipeline was used to generate FLNC reads ensuring each has a poly-A tail, plus a single 3' and 5' primer signal for downstream analysis.
    </p>
  <li>Mapping
    <p> Resulting reads were aligned to the marmoset genome with
      <code>minimap2 2.17-r941</code> using the options 
      <code>-t 12 -ax splice:hq -u</code>.
    </p>
</ol>
