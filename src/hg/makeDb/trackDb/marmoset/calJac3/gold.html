<P>
This track shows the draft assembly of the $organism genome.  

Whole-genome shotgun reads were assembled into contigs.  When possible, 
contigs were grouped into scaffolds (also known as &quot;supercontigs&quot;).
The order, orientation and gap sizes between contigs within a scaffold are
based on paired-end read evidence. </P>
<P>
In dense mode, this track depicts the contigs that make up the 
currently viewed scaffold. 
Contig boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Where gaps
exist between contigs, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  The relative order and orientation of the contigs
within a scaffold is always known; therefore, a line is drawn in the graphical
display to bridge the blocks.</P>
<P>
There are 81 finished contigs in this assembly marked as type &quot;F&quot;,
the rest of the contigs (194,893) are of fragment type &quot;W&quot;: 
Whole Genome Shotgun contig. </P>
<P>
The assembled chromosomes are constructed from 173,858 contigs
with a total of 2,621,297,226 bp and 24,828 contigs larger than
the N50 size of 30,493 bp.
