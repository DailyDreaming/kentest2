<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track counts the overlaps of the chain links from the <em> Self Chain</em>
alignments.  It is a rough measure of how often a sequence can be found
in the complete genome.
</p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>
The counting is performed:
<pre>
hgsql -N -e 'select tName,tStart,tEnd from chainSelfLink;' oxyTri2 \
   &gt; oxyTri2.chainSelfLink.bed
sort -S1G --parallel=30  -k1,1 -k2,2n oxyTri2.chainSelfLink.bed &gt; sorted.bed
bedItemOverlapCount  oxyTri2 sorted.bed &gt; pileUps.bedGraph
bedGraphToBigWig pileUps.bedGraph oxyTri2.chrom.sizes selfChainPileUps.bw
</pre>
