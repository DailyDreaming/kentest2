"Presence of SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in COVID-19 patients and healthy donors"</a>.</p>
<p>
The authors stimulated PBMCs with two sets (M1 and M2) of overlapping SARS-CoV peptide pools.  
Importantly, these are SARS-CoV peptides that have experimental support as putative MHC-II 
epitopes for SARS-CoV, but note they do not all 100% match SARS-Cov-2 sequence.<br><br>
Using these peptide sets, the authors "demonstrate the presence of S-reactive CD4+ 52 
T cells in 83% of COVID-19 patients, 53 as well as in 34% of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative 
healthy donors (HD), albeit at lower frequencies."</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p> 
Two tracks are available:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>M1_peptides</b>: The more N-terminal peptide library</li>
<li><b>M2 peptides</b>: The more C-terminal peptide library</li>
</ul>

<p>
The annotated interval represents the alignment of the peptide to the viral
genome. The sequence displayed in the name is the SARS-CoV peptide sequence (the actual 
sequence that was used in the paper, not necessarily
identical to the SARS-CoV-2 peptide).</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Table S1 contains the peptide sequences (SARS-CoV sequence) used. This table was 
downloaded and tblastn was used to align the identified SARS-CoV peptides to the SARS-CoV-2 genome.</p>
<p>
A small number of peptides were not found or reported erroneous hits, in which the coordinates 
were identified by manually blat-ing the SARS-CoV-2 sequence from the alignments reported in Fig S1.</p>
