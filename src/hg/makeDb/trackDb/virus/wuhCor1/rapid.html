<h2>Description</h2>

<p> This track shows the primers for the 
<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.122648v2" target="_blank">RAPID</a> 
SARS-CoV-2 sequencing protocol, also commonly referred to as Midnight.
The primers enable amplification of the genome of SARS-CoV-2.
This approach uses multiplexed 1200 base pair (bp) tiled amplicons. Briefly, two PCR 
reactions are performed for each SARS-CoV-2 positive patient sample to be sequenced. 
One PCR reaction contains thirty primers that generate the odd numbered 
amplicons (&quot;Pool 1&quot;), while the second PCR reaction contains twenty eight primers 
that generate the even numbered amplicons (&quot;Pool 2&quot;). After PCR, the two amplicon 
pools are combined and can be used for a range of downstream sequencing approaches. Primers 
were all designed using <a href=" https://primalscheme.com/" target="_blank">Primal Scheme
</a> and described in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2017.066">
Nature Protocols 2017</a>. This primer set results in amplicons that exhibit lower levels of 
variation in coverage compared to other commonly used primer sets.

Genomic locations of primers are highlighted. A click on them shows the primer pool. 
This is one of the few tracks that may be best displayed in "full" mode.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
RAPID primer sequences were downloaded from the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M5I_C56ZC8_2Ycgm9EFieVlVNqxsP7dXAnGoBZy3nDo
/edit#gid=755704891" target="_blank">Google Spreadsheet</a> and converted to bigBed. More 
details are available in the paper referenced below or in the 
supplemental files on <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3897530#.XwM3ApMzZ0v">Zenodo</a>.
</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the
<a href="hgTables">Table Browser</a> or combined with other datasets in the
<a href="hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a> tool.
For automated analysis, the genome annotation is stored in
a bigBed file that can be downloaded from
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/wuhCor1/bbi/rapid.bb">the download server</a>.</p>
<p>
Annotations can
be converted from binary to ASCII text by our command-line tool bigBedToBed.
Instructions for downloading this command can be found on our
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">utilities page</a>.
The tool can also be used to obtain features within a given range without downloading the file,
for example:</p>
<code>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/wuhCor1/bbi/rapid.bb -chrom=NC_045512v2 -start=0 -end=29902 stdout</code>
