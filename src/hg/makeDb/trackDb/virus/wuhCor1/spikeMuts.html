<h2>Description</h2> 
<p>
The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which binds the virus to host cells, is a key target of vaccine development to
combat COVID-19, and mutations in this protein have potential to change infectivity and response to disease treatments
as well as vaccine efficacy.
As of January 2021 more than a dozen mutations in this protein have been detected via sequencing worldwide, and
one particular mutation, <em>N501</em>, has been designated a 'Variant of Concern', as epidemiological markers
suggest viruses carrying this mutation are significantly more transmissible.</p>
<p>
This track presents amino acid mutations identified in the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein, based on the
