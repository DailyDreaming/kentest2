<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track contains deep mutational scanning data measuring the effect of the mutations to 
the Spike RBD to binding of 10 antibodies using a yeast surface display system. The results are
described
in <a target=_blank href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33259788">Greaney et al, Cell Host Microbe 2020.</a>
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>Scores represent the &quot;escape fraction&quot; (discussed at length in the Methods 
of the paper) which &quot;represent the fraction of a given variant that escape antibody 
binding, and should in principle range from 0 to 1.&quot;</p>

<p>A higher score indicates a greater level of escape.</p>

<p>Each subtrack contains all the scores representing mutations to a particular amino 
acid (each annotation is a Spike codon). For instance the A subtrack measures the escape 
fraction for a particular antibody if the annotated amino acid is mutated to alanine (if 
the wildtype amino acid is A, then the score is 0). The &quot;total&quot; subtracks 
represent the sum of all escape fractions for all amino acid changes at a position. 
The &quot;max&quot; subtracks are the escape fraction for the amino acid substitution 
with the greatest escape fraction.</p>

<p>&quot;Note that the magnitude of the measured effects of mutations on antibody escape depends on
the antibody concentration and the flow cytometry gates applied, meaning that the
escape fractions are comparable across sites for any given antibody, but are not precisely
comparable among antibodies without external calibration.&quot;</p>
