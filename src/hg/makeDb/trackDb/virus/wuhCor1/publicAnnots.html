<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
<p>This track shows annotations made via a public spreadsheet available at <a target=_blank 
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l38ypTcQH2AP2hlBmQ7kIXz1G4e33RPX-iFH1vu-utU/edit#gid=0">http://bit.ly/cov2annots</a>.

<p>Originally, anyone could add annotations to this spreadsheet and they went live after 1-2 days.
We switched off the automated updates from the spreadsheet to the track in mid-2021. To add changes to this track now, 
please contact us.

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p> 
<p>Only start-end annotations can be shown. Contact us at <b>genome-www@soe.ucsc.edu</b> if you 
have feedback on the form, e.g. you need exon or intron lines or have datasets with 
more than 5-10 annotations.</p>
