<h2>Description</h2>

<p> This track shows the primers for the 
  <a href="https://swiftbiosci.com/swift-amplicon-sars-cov-2-panel/"
     target="_blank">Swift Amplicon &#174; SARS-CoV-2 Panel</a> single-tube NGS assay:
  <blockquote>
This kit leverages patented multiplex PCR technology, enabling library construction from
1st-strand or 2nd-strand cDNA using tiled primer pairs to target the entire 29.9 kb viral
genome with a single pool of multiplexed primer pairs.
Primers were designed against the NCBI Reference Sequence NC_045512.2 (Severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, complete genome).
In silico analysis predicted zero off-target products from human host genome sequences.

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
Genomic locations of primers are highlighted. A click on them shows the primer sequence. 
This is one of the few tracks that may be best displayed in "full" mode.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Primer sequences, names and genomic locations were
<a href="https://swiftbiosci.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/sarscov2_v1_masterfile.txt.zip"
   target=_blank>downloaded from Swift</a>
and converted to bigBed.  More details are available from

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the
<a href="hgTables">Table Browser</a> or combined with other datasets in the
<a href="hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a> tool.
For automated analysis, the genome annotation is stored in
a bigBed file that can be downloaded from
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/wuhCor1/bbi/swift.bb">the download server</a>.</p>
<p>
Annotations can
be converted from binary to ASCII text by our command-line tool bigBedToBed.
Instructions for downloading this command can be found on our
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">utilities page</a>.
The tool can also be used to obtain features within a given range without downloading the file,
for example:</p>
<code>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/wuhCor1/bbi/swift.bb -chrom=NC_045512v2 -start=0 -end=29902 stdout</code>
