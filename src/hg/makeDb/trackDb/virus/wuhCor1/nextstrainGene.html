<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov" target=_blank>Nextstrain.org</a> displays
data about mutations that occur in the current 2019/2020 outbreak.
Nextstrain has a powerful user interface for viewing the evolutionary tree
that it infers from the patterns of mutations in sequences worldwide, but
does not offer a detailed plot of mutations along the genome, so we have processed
their genome annotations into genome browser tracks.
</p>
<p>
Use this track in conjunction with the track
<em>Nextstrain Mutations</em> (protein-coding mutations use gene names from this track).
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Nextstrain downloads SARS-CoV-2 genomes from
  <a href="https://gisaid.org/" target=_blank>GISAID</a>
  as they are submitted by labs worldwide.
  The sequences are processed by an
  <a href="https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov" target=_blank>automated pipeline</a>
  and annotations are written to a data file
  that UCSC downloads and extracts annotations for display.</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
You can download the bigBed file underlying this track (nextstrainGene) from our 
<a href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/wuhCor1/nextstrain/" 
target=_blank>Download Server.</a> The data can be explored interactively with 
the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a>
or the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>. The data can be
accessed from scripts through our <a href="https://api.genome.ucsc.edu">API</a>.</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>Thanks to
  <a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov" target=_blank>nextstrain.org</a> for
  sharing its analysis of genomes collected by
  <a href="https://gisaid.org/" target=_blank>GISAID</a>,
  and to researchers worldwide for sharing their SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences.
