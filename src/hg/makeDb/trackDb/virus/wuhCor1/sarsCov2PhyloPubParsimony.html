<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Given a phylogenetic tree of related sequences,
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_parsimony_(phylogenetics)"
     target=_blank>parsimony</a> score
can be computed for each mutation as the minimum number of nucleotide changes along branches
of the tree that would lead to the observed sample genotypes at the leaves of the tree.
For example, if there is a branch for which all leaves have a mutation, and no other leaves of
the tree have the mutation, then the mutation presumably occurred once on that branch and the
parsimony score would be one.  However, when a mutation appears on leaves belonging to several
branches whose other leaves do not have the mutation, then the mutation would need to occur
on multiple branches in the tree, increasing the parsimony score.  Mutations with a parsimony
score that is relatively high, especially when compared to alternate allele count (the number 
of samples/leaves with the mutation), may be of interest when identifying systematic errors
and/or sites of recurrent mutations.

This track shows the parsimony score of each single nucleotide substitution
found in sequences available from
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/virus?SeqType_s=Nucleotide&VirusLineage_ss=SARS-CoV-2,%20taxid:2697049" target=_blank>NCBI Virus / GenBank</a>,
<a href="https://www.cogconsortium.uk/data/" target=_blank>COG-UK</a> and the
<a href="https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/release_genome"
   target=_blank>China National Center for Bioinformation</a>,
in a phylogenetic tree based on
<a href="https://github.com/roblanf/sarscov2phylo/" target=_blank>sarscov2phylo</a>
release <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4289383" target=_blank>13-11-20</a> (Lanfear)
with more recent public sequences added using
<a href="https://github.com/yatisht/usher" target=_blank>UShER</a> (Turakhia <em>et al.</em>),
as a bar graph with the height indicating the score.
(The <a href="hgTrackUi?db=wuhCor1&g=sarsCov2PhyloPub"><em>Phylogeny: Public</em> track</a>
displays the phylogenetic tree and sample genotypes
from which the parsimony scores were generated.)
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Parsimony scores were extracted from the output of the find_parsimonious_assignments program from the
<a href="https://github.com/yatisht/strain_phylogenetics" target=_blank>strain_phylogenetics</a>
package (Turakhia <em> et al.</em>).
See the <a href="hgTrackUi?db=wuhCor1&g=sarsCov2PhyloPub"><em>Phylogeny: Public</em> track</a>
for details about the phylogenetic tree and mutations.
