<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows data from Gordon et al, 2020 <a target=_blank

SARS-CoV-2-Human Protein-Protein Interaction Map Reveals Drug Targets and
Potential Drug-Repurposing"</a>.

<p>
The authors cloned, tagged, and expressed 26
of the mature proteins expressed by SARS-CoV-2 in 293 human cells and used
affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to identify human proteins that
interact with viral proteins. <br><br>332 high confidence interactions are reported
betwen human and viral proteins. 

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p> 
On the viral genome the coordinates of the viral protein are marked and labeled with the 
name of the human interactor.</p> 
<p>
The bed file also includes the <a target=_blank 
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4378866/">MIST</a> score * 1000.  
A MIST score of 1 is a highly reproducible and specific interaction, scores 
are multipled by 1000 for display purposes.</p>
<p>
The set of interactions displayed here includes <b>only</b> the 332 "high confidence" 
interactions that met criteria for significance (using a MIST cutoff &gt;= 0.7 as well 
as "a SAINTexpress BFDR &lt;= 0.05 and an average spectral count &gt;= 2.").</p> 

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
The tab delimited version of supplementary table 2 was downloaded from <a 
target=_blank href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/03/22/2020.03.22.002386/DC5/embed/media-5.xlsx?download=true">
biorxiv</a>. This table lists the viral protein that served as the "bait" and 
Uniprot identifiers of human proteins that were captured as "prey".</p>
<p>
A version of the "UniProt Mature Protein Products (Polypeptide Chains)" track was then manually 
modified to rename ORFs to match paper nomenclature as indicated by Figure 1.</p>
<p>
The table was then joined and MIST scores multipled by 1000 to produce a track reporting 
interactions.</p>
