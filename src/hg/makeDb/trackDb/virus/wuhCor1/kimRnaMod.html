<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows the locations of RNA-modifications as determined by Nanopore sequencing 
<a href="https://www.cell.com/pb-assets/products/coronavirus/CELL_CELL-D-20-00765.pdf" target="_blank">
    Kim et al, Cell 2020</a>.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
Very small tickmarks indicate the position of the RNA modifications on the
genome. One has to zoom in to basepair level detail to see their exact extent. A
small barchart over the tick indicates the fraction of transcripts that are modified
relative to the un-modified transcripts. E.g. frac=0.3 means that 30% of the transcripts
were modified. There is one barchart per transcript.
</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the
<a href="hgTables">Table Browser</a>, or combined with other datasets in the
<a href="hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a> tool.
For automated analysis, the genome annotation is stored in
a bigBed file that can be downloaded from
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/wuhCor1/bbi/kim2020">the download server</a>.</p>

<p>
Annotations can
be converted from binary to ASCII text by our command-line tool bigBedToBed.
Instructions for downloading this command can be found on our
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">utilities page</a>.
The tool can also be used to obtain features within a given range without downloading the file,
for example:</p>
<code>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/wuhCor1/bbi/kim2020.bb -chrom=NC_045512v2 -start=0 -end=29902 stdout</code>
