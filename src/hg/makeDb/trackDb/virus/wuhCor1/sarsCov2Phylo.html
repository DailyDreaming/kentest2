<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track displays a phylogenetic tree inferred from SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences collected by
<a href="https://gisaid.org" target=_blank>GISAID</a>,
and mutations found in the sequences.  By default, only very common mutations (alternate allele found
in at least 1% of samples) are displayed, but other subtracks may be made visible in order to see
more rare mutations.
The phylogenetic tree is inferred by Rob Lanfear's
<a href="https://github.com/roblanf/sarscov2phylo/" target=_blank>sarscov2phylo</a> pipeline.
For display in the narrow space to the left of the main genome browser image, nodes in the tree
are collapsed unless a mutation is associated with a node; i.e. the only branching points displayed
are those at which mutations occurred.
</p>
<p>
Two options for coloring the tree, by
<a href="https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin/" target=_blank>Pangolin</a>
lineage (Rambaut <em>et al.</em>) or
<a href="https://www.gisaid.org/references/statements-clarifications/clade-and-lineage-nomenclature-aids-in-genomic-epidemiology-of-active-hcov-19-viruses/"
   target=_blank>GISAID clade</a>,
are available.
Both coloring schemes are adapted from Figure 1 of
(<a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.32.2001410"
    target=_blank>Alm <em>et al.</em></a>) which presents a unified view of a simplified
phylogenetic tree, Pangolin lineages,
<a href="https://nextstrain.org/blog/2020-06-02-SARSCoV2-clade-naming"
   target=_blank>Nextstrain clades</a> and GISAID clades.

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
In &quot;dense&quot; mode, a vertical line is drawn at each position where there is a mutation.
In &quot;pack&quot; mode, the display shows a plot of all samples' mutations, with samples
ordered using the phylogenetic tree in order to highlight patterns of linkage.</p>
<p>
Each sample is placed in a horizontal row of pixels; when the number of
samples exceeds the number of vertical pixels for the track, multiple
samples fall in the same pixel row and pixels are averaged across samples.</p>
<p>
Each mutation is a vertical bar at its position in the SARS-CoV-2 genome
with white (invisible) representing the reference allele;
the non-reference allele is shown in red if it changes the protein sequence of a gene,
green if it falls within a gene but does not change the protein,
and black if it does not fall within a gene.
Tick marks are drawn at the top and bottom of each mutation's vertical bar
to make the bar more visible when most alleles are reference alleles.
Only single-nucleotide mutations are displayed, not insertions or deletions.
</p>
<p>
The phylogenetic tree showing inferred relationships between the samples is depicted
in the left column of the display.
Mousing over this will show the GISAID identifiers for the different samples.
At the default track height, about 100 samples are averaged into each row of pixels.
The track height can be adjusted in the track controls, which can be reached by
clicking on the gray button to the left of the tree or by right-clicking on the image.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.robertlanfear.com/" target=_blank>Rob Lanfear</a> regularly runs the
<a href="https://github.com/roblanf/sarscov2phylo/" target=_blank>sarscov2phylo</a> pipeline
on all complete, high-coverage sequences available from
<a href="https://gisaid.org" target=_blank>GISAID</a>.
The pipeline aligns all sequences to the same reference genome used by the Genome Browser
(RefSeq <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512.2" target=_blank>NC_045512.2</a>,
GenBank <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3" target=_blank>MN908947.3</a>,
GISAID sample hCoV-19/Wuhan/Hu-1/2019|EPI_ISL_402125|2019-12-31)
using
<a href="https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/" target=_blank>MAFFT</a>
(Katoh <em>et al.</em>).
It masks sites identified as problematic by the 
<a href="https://github.com/W-L/ProblematicSites_SARS-CoV2/"
   target=_blank>ProblematicSites_SARS-CoV2</a> repository
(De Maio <em>et al.</em>, Turakhia <em>et al.</em>),
as well as sites that are N's or gaps in >50% of samples.
<a href="http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/" target=_blank>fasttree</a>
(Price <em>et al.</em>)
is used to infer the phylogenetic tree;
sequences on very long branches are removed using
<a href="https://github.com/uym2/TreeShrink" target=_blank>TreeShrink</a>
(Mai <em>et al.</em>).
The tree is re-rooted to hCoV-19/Wuhan/WH04/2020|EPI_ISL_406801|2020-01-05.

<a href="https://github.com/roblanf/sarscov2phylo/" target=_blank>sarscov2phylo</a>
documentation.
</p>
<p>Collapsing of nodes that do not have an associated mutation is done using
<a href="https://github.com/yatisht/strain_phylogenetics" target=_blank>strain_phylogenetics</a>
(Turakhia <em>et al.</em>).

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
You can download the VCF files underlying this track (gisaid.*.vcf.gz) from our
<a href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/wuhCor1/sarsCov2Phylo/" 
target=_blank>Download Server</a>. The data can be explored interactively with the 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a>
or the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Note: while the VCF files contain mutations found in sequences collected by
<a href="https://gisaid.org" target=_blank>GISAID</a>,
they are not sufficient to reconstruct the original sequences available from GISAID
due to treatment of ambiguous IUPAC bases as missing information in the VCF and
omission of insertion and deletion mutations.  Additionally, the subtracks that are
filtered to include only mutations found in a minimum percentage of samples give
very incomplete representations of samples.  Researchers wishing to work with SARS-CoV-2
genomic sequences should register with GISAID and download the full sequences.
