<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The NCBI Mature Proteins track for the 13 Jan 2020
  <em>SARS-CoV-2 virus</em>/GCF_009858895.2 genome assembly is
constructed from the NCBI nuccore entry for <b>NC_045512.2 </b>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512.2"
target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512.2
</a>
</p>
<p>It shows the mature peptides, after cleavage, as annotated on the Genbank record.</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the 
<a href="hgTables">Table Browser</a>, or the 
<a href="hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>. 
For automated analysis, the genome annotation is stored in 
a bigBed file that can be downloaded from 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/wuhCor1/">the download server</a>. 

Annotations can
be converted to ASCII text by our tool bigBedToBed which can be compiled from 
the source code or downloaded as a precompiled binary for your system. 
Instructions for downloading source code and binaries can be found on our
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">utilities page</a>.
The tool can also be used to obtain features within a given range, 
for example:
</p>
<code>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/wuhCor1/ncbiGene.bb -chrom=NC_045512v2 -start=0 -end=29902 stdout</code>
