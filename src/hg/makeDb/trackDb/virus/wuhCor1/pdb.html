<h2>Description</h2>

<p> This track shows alignments of sequences with known protein structures in the 
<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/" target="_blank">Protein Data Bank</a> (PDB).
The PDB protein sequence has to match the genome over at least 80% of its length,
so somewhat similar sequences, e.g. from the SARS 2003 outbreak, are also shown.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
Genomic locations of PDB matches are labeled with the accession number. 
A click on them shows a standard feature detail page with the PDB page integrated into it. 
The protein structure is shown on the PDB page.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
PDB sequences were downloaded from the 
<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/pdb/download/download.do" target="_blank">PDB website</a> and aligned 
with BLAT. Only alignments with a minimum identity of 80%
that span at least 80% of the query sequence were kept.</p>
