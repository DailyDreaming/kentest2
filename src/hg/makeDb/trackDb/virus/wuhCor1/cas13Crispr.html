<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows the <em>in-silico</em> design of crRNAs for Cas13 using
the tool <a href="https://github.com/QilabGitHub/nCov2019_Guide_Design" 
target="_blank">nCov2019_Guide_Design</a>, as described in Abbott <em>et al.</em>, 2020.</p>

<p>
To target highly conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, an <em>in-silico</em> collection of 
all 3,802 possible crRNAs were generated. After excluding crRNAs that are either predicted 
to have potential off-target binding (&#8804;2 mismatches in the human transcriptome) or 
having poly-T sequences that may prevent crRNA expression (&#8805;4 consecutive Ts), a set 
of 3,203 crRNAs were obtained. These crRNAs are also able to target SARS and 
MERS with &#8804;1 mismatch.</p>

<p>
Each crRNA has been characterized with four features:
<ul>
<li>Efficiency is predicted using the online tool at <a target=_"blank" 
href="https://gitlab.com/sanjanalab/cas13">https://gitlab.com/sanjanalab/cas13</a></li> 
<li>Specificy is determined by the number of off-target loci in human mRNA with &#8804;2 
mismatches to the crRNA</li> 
<li>Generality within Coronaviridae is quantified as the percentage of Coronaviridae strains 
targeted by the given crRNA with perfect identity</li> 
<li>Generality within SARS-CoV-2 is quantified as the percentage of 1,087 SARS-CoV-2 patient 
genomes downloaded on March 20, 2020 that are targeted by the given crRNA with perfect 
identity</li></ul></p>

<h2>Method</h2>
<p>
To design all possible crRNAs for the three pathogenic RNA viruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, 
and MERS-CoV), the reference genomes of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, along with SARS-CoV-2 genomes 
derived from 47 patients were first aligned by MAFFT using the --auto flag. 
crRNA candidates were identified by using a sliding window to extract all 22-nucleotide 
(nt) sequences with perfect identity among the SARS-CoV-2 genomes.</p>
<p>
We annotated each crRNA candidate with the number of mismatches relative to the SARS-CoV 
and MERS-CoV genomes, as well as the GC content. 3,802 crRNA candidates were selected with 
perfect match against the 47 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and with &#8804;1 mismatch to SARS-CoV 
or MERS-CoV sequences. To characterize the specificity of 22-nt crRNAs, we ensured 
that each crRNA does not target any sequences in the human transcriptome.</p>
<p>
We used Bowtie 1.2.2 to align crRNAs to the human transcriptome (hg38; 
including non-coding RNA) and removed crRNAs that mapped to the human 
transcriptome with &#8804;2 mismatches.</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the
<a href="hgTables">Table Browser</a>, or combined with other datasets in the
<a href="hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a> tool.
For automated analysis, the genome annotation is stored in
a bigBed file that can be downloaded from
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/wuhCor1/bbi/cas13Crispr.bb">the download server</a>.</p>
<p>
Annotations can
be converted from binary to ASCII text by our command-line tool bigBedToBed.
Instructions for downloading this command can be found on our
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">utilities page</a>.
The tool can also be used to obtain features within a given range without downloading the file,
for example:</p>
<code>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/wuhCor1/bbi/cas13Crispr.bb -chrom=NC_045512v2 -start=0 -end=29902 stdout</code>
