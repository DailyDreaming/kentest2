<p>The authors use several statistical techniques to identify selection sites of interest in 
SARS-CoV-2 data from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gisaid.org/about-us/mission/">GISAID</a>.
Each site receives points for eight different categories, explained below, and sites with 
the most points are ranked higher.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
 
<p>The gray to black color scale denotes increasing scores for selection sites 
where each site has the potential to receive one additional point for any of the 
eight following categories.</p>

<p><b>Positive Selection:</b> &quot;On average along interior 
tree branches, this site has a dN/dS&gt;1 is accumulating non-synonymous changes (some 
of which might have a functional impact, but most probably don't) faster 
relative to synonymous changes than would be expected under neutral evolution.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Negative Selection:</b> &quot;On average along interior 
tree branches, this site has a dN/dS&lt;1, meaning that it conserved, i.e. 
non-synonymous changes might be selected against. Note that sites with no 
changes (i.e. perfectly conserved sites) cannot be detected by dN/dS based methods&quot;</p>

<p><b>Multiple Clades:</b> &quot;If a site belongs to this 
category, then at least two internal branches in the tree are inferred to be 
subject to positive selection, implying several selective events (not just a 
single introduction)&quot;</p>

<p><b>Increasing frequency:</b> &quot;When a site belongs to 
this category, alternative amino-acids at this site has an increasing frequency 
trend (based on applying the Jonckheere-Terpstra test to 10-day intervals)&quot;</p>

<p><b>Predicted CTL epitopes:</b> &quot;This site belongs to 
one or more CTL linear epitopes that are predicted to be recognized by one or 
more HLA alleles reported in Campbell <i>et al</i>&quot;</p>

<p><b>Intra-host variants:</b> &quot;When a site belongs to 
this category, there is at least one deep sequencing dataset that shows the presence 
of intra-host variation at the same site at between 2 and 90%.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Unexpected residues:</b> &quot;When a site belongs to 
this category, there is at least one amino-acid present in more than one 
sequence that was not predicted to occur at this site based on the evolution 
of other betacoronaviruses. It might indicate evolutionary events that we 
have not observed in similar viruses before.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Selected in animals:</b> &quot;There is evidence of 
positive selection or differential selection acting on the bat/pangolin isolates 
closely related to the SARS-CoV-2 genome based on data from Boni <i>et al</i>&quot;</p>

<p><b>New</b> is any site that was recently detected as of June 30th, 2020.</p>  

<p><b>Selection</b> is any site at which positive or negative selection occurs.</p>

<p>For representation purposes scores (0-7) have been scaled to 500-1000.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The JSON used to generate the Genomic Coordinates of selection sites was parsed 
and the position, gene, site_in_gene, kind, score, and type fields were used to 
generate the resulting fields provided for each &quot;kind&quot; provided in the data.</p>
