<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Attempts to infer phylogenetic relationships, sites under selection, or evidence of recombination
from SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences can be led astray by sequencing errors, contamination, and
hypermutable sites.  In order to make reliable inferences, it is important to identify probable
errors and susceptible sites within the genome sequences, carefully consider how those might
affect the specific analysis one is about to perform, and perhaps exclude problematic sites from
analysis.
</p>
<p>
This track shows locations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that have been identified as problematic for
analysis for various reasons.  They have been collected in the github repository
<a href="https://github.com/W-L/ProblematicSites_SARS-CoV2/"
   target=_blank>https://github.com/W-L/ProblematicSites_SARS-CoV2/</a>.
Locations have been separated into two subtracks and colored corresponding to levels of severity:
<ul>
  <li><b><span style="color: red">Mask</span></b>: Problems are expected to affect most types
    of analysis, so it is recommended to mask out these sites before analysis.
  <li><b><span style="color: #f0a000">Caution</span></b>: Some types of analysis may be
    affected while other types may not; caution is recommended.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Locations are labeled with the following terms to indicate the type of potential problem:
  <ul>
    <li><b>ambiguous</b>: Sites which show an excess of ambiguous basecalls relative to the 
      number of alternative alleles, often emerging from a single country or sequencing laboratory
    <li><b>amended</b>: Previous sequencing errors which now appear to have been fixed in the
      latest versions of the GISAID sequences, at least in sequences from some of the sequencing
      laboratories
    <li><b>highly_ambiguous</b>: Sites with a very high proportion of ambiguous characters,
      relative to the number of alternative alleles
    <li><b>highly_homoplasic</b>: Positions which are extremely homoplasic - it is sometimes not
      necessarily clear if these are hypermutable sites or sequencing artefacts
    <li><b>homoplasic</b>: Homoplasic sites, with many mutation events needed to explain a
      relatively small alternative allele count
    <li><b>interspecific_contamination</b>: Cases (only one instance as of July 2020) in which
      the known sequencing issue is due to contamination from genetic material that does not have
      SARS-CoV-2 origin
    <li><b>nanopore_adapter</b>: Cases in which the known sequencing issue is due to the adapter
      sequences in nanopore reads
    <li><b>narrow_src</b>: Mutations which are found in sequences from only a few sequencing labs 
      (usually two or three), possibly as a consequence of the same artefact reproduced independently
    <li><b>neighbour_linked</b>: Proximal mutations displaying near perfect linkage
    <li><b>seq_end</b>: Alignment ends are affected by low coverage and high error rates
      (masking recommended, but might be more stringent than necessary)
    <li><b>single_src</b>: Only observed in samples from a single laboratory
  </ul>

</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Multiple groups applied various methods (De Maio, Walker <em>et al.</em>;
De Maio, Gozashti <em>et al.</em>; Turakhia <em>et al.</em>) to identify sites that
were homoplasic, likely contaminated, likely sequencing error and/or observed in multiple
virus lineages by only one or a few laboratories.  They contributed their observations
and recommendations to the github repository
<a href="https://github.com/W-L/ProblematicSites_SARS-CoV2/"
   target=_blank>https://github.com/W-L/ProblematicSites_SARS-CoV2/</a>.
UCSC downloaded the collection, split the sites into Mask and Caution subsets depending
on the recommended action and reformatted the data for display in the Genome Browser.
