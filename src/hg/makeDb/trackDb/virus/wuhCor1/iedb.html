<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows epitope sequences displayed by various class I MHC alleles as
annotated by National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.iedb.org">Immune Epitope Database (IEDB)</a>. Only the epitopes
with positive assays are displayed on this track. These epitopes were validated using many different methods. Click through to the IEDB page for each individual epitope to see how that epitope was validated.

<p>
EpitopeID is a clickable link to each epitope on the IEDB site where details about
assays, literature and HLA restriction are provided.  </p>
