<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
This track shows the locations of RNA structure predictions reported in
<a target=_blank href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.012906">
Rangan et al. bioRxiv 2020</a>
as well as recognizable matches to Rfam annotations found at 
<a target=_blank href="https://rfam.xfam.org/search?q=coronavirus">

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p> 
At zoomed out positions, RNA structure is indicated by dark (stem) and light (loops 
and single strands) green color bars. Zooming in to base level displays the prediction 
in <a target=_blank 
href="https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/ViennaRNA/doc/html/rna_structure_notations.html">
"extended dot-bracket" notation</a>.</p>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<p>
This track was created by UCSC undergraduate students Justin Sim and Alinne Gonzalez Armenta 
with the indispensable assistance of Brian Raney.</p>
