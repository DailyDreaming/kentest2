<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov" target=_blank>Nextstrain.org</a> displays
data about variants that occur in the current 2019/2020 outbreak.
Nextstrain has a powerful user interface for viewing the timestamped molecular phylogeny tree
that it infers from the patterns of variants in sequences worldwide using the
<a href="https://github.com/neherlab/treetime" target=_blank>TreeTime</a> algorithm.
Nextstrain also produces weekly situation reports (e.g.
<a href="https://nextstrain.org/narratives/ncov/sit-rep/2020-03-20"
   target=_blank>March 20th, 2020</a>), in which they highlight certain branches of
the tree.  They define clades in terms of a small number of
variants that define the branches as the mechanism to highlight the branches of interest
in the situation reports.
Nextstrain cautions that these clades
<a href="https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/issues/208#issuecomment-600491195"
   target=_blank>are not officially recognized</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/issues/207#issuecomment-600756907"
   target=_blank>should not be over-interpreted</a>,
but since the clades are an interesting feature of Nextstrain and can be used to
label and color nodes in Nextstrain's tree display, we display each clade
as a feature that spans the genome, with tall boxes at the locations of
mutations that occurred on the path from the reference to the clade.
</p>

<p>
The clades displayed in this track are Nextstrain's "old" clades, i.e. the letter-number-letter
designations used from March 5th through the morning of June 2nd, 2020, at which point they
switched over to the current year-letter system.  
</p>

<p>
The <em>Nextstrain Variants</em> track contains all variants shown on Nextstrain,
of which this track's variants are a very small subset.
Nextstrain assigns both an old clade (if applicable) and a new clade to each sample,
and has an option to <a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global?c=legacy_clade_membership"
 target=_blank>color by old clade</a>.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Nextstrain downloads SARS-CoV-2 genomes from
  <a href="https://gisaid.org/" target=_blank>GISAID</a>
  as they are submitted by labs worldwide.
  Nextstrain identifies variants that define clades of interest and puts them in the file
  <a href="https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/blob/master/config/clades.tsv"
     target=_blank>clades.tsv</a>
  (note: these "old" clades are defined in
  <a href="https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/blob/master/config/legacy_clades.tsv"
     target=_blank>legacy_clades.tsv</a>.
  The genome sequences and metadata including clades.tsv are processed by an
  <a href="https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov" target=_blank>automated pipeline</a>
  and annotations are written to a data file
  that UCSC downloads and extracts annotations for display.</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>You can download the bigBed file underlying this track (nextstrainOldClade.bb) from our 
<a href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/wuhCor1/nextstrain/" 
target=_blank>Download Server</a>. The data can be explored interactively with the 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a>
or the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>. The data can also be
accessed from scripts through our <a href="https://api.genome.ucsc.edu">API</a>.</p>
