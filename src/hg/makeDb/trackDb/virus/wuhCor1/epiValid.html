<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows epitopes that were validated in published studies, mostly from the SARS 2003 outbreak.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The epitope sequences were collected by Nerli et al, partially from the IEDB database, partially
from the original literature. The details page shows how similar the SARS-Cov-2 epitope is to the
SARS epitope.

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the
