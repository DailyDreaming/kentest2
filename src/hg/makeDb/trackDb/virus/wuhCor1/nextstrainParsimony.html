<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov" target=_blank>Nextstrain.org</a> displays
data about single nucleotide mutation alleles in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein sequences that have
occurred in different samples of the virus during the current 2019/2020 outbreak.
Nextstrain has a powerful user interface for viewing the time stamped phylogenetic tree
that it infers from the patterns of mutations in sequences worldwide.
Nextstrain maintains an ongoing pipeline that continuously obtains SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences
and metadata from
<a href="https://gisaid.org" target=_blank>GISAID</a>,
aligns them against the reference genome
(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512.2" target=_blank>NC_045512.2</a>),
and infers a phylogenetic tree.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_parsimony_(phylogenetics)"
     target=_blank>parsimony</a> score
can be computed for each mutation as the minimum number of nucleotide changes along branches
of the tree that would lead to the observed sample genotypes at the leaves of the tree.
For example, if there is a branch for which all leaves have a mutation, and no other leaves of
the tree have the mutation, then the mutation presumably occurred once on that branch and the
parsimony score would be one.  However, when a mutation appears on leaves belonging to several
branches whose other leaves do not have the mutation, then the mutation would need to occur
on multiple branches in the tree, increasing the parsimony score.  Mutations with a parsimony
score that is relatively high, especially when compared to alternate allele count (the number 
of samples/leaves with the mutation), may be of interest when identifying systematic errors
and/or sites of recurrent mutations.
</p>
<p>
This track shows the parsimony score of each single-nucleotide substitution reported by Nextstrain
as a bar graph
with the height indicating the score.
(The <a href="hgTrackUi?db=wuhCor1&g=nextstrainSamples"><em>Nextstrain Mutations</em> track</a>
displays the phylogenetic tree and sample genotypes
from which the parsimony scores were generated.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Nextstrain downloads SARS-CoV-2 genomes from
  <a href="https://gisaid.org/" target=_blank>GISAID EpiCoV TM</a>
  as they are submitted by labs worldwide.
  The sequences are processed by an
  <a href="https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov" target=_blank>automated pipeline</a>
  and annotations are written to a data file
  that UCSC downloads and extracts annotations for display.
  UCSC computes parsimony scores using the phylogenetic tree and mutations extracted
  from Nextstrain.</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
