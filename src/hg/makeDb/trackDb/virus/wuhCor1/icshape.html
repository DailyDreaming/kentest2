<H2>Description</H2>
<p>This track shows normalized icSHAPE reactivity data of in vivo and in vitro SARS-CoV-2 experiments.
</p>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<p>
icSHAPE scores were provided by Qiangfeng Cliff Zhang and converted to bigWig.
The first five nucleotides of the genome and the last thirty nucleotides have
no data due to technical defects (on the 5' and 3' ends of the virus) or insufficient 
sequencing depth. The icSHAPE score is distributed between 0 and 1.
</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
You can download the bigWig file underlying this track (icshape/*.bw) from our
