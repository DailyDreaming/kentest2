<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows putative epitopes for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells whose HLA binding 
properties cover over 99% for US, European, and Asian populations, for both HLA-I and HLA-II.
The track includes 11,776 CD8 epitopes restricted to HLA-I as predicted by RECON. All the epitopes 
are scored using a combined coverage score reported for USA, EUR, and API. Specifically, 
score = (USA_coverage+EUR_coverage+API_coverage)*1000/3.<br><br>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
Genomic locations of epitopes are labeled with a unique ID. Mousing over an item shows
the protein name and restrictions to HLA-I. A click on an item shows a standard feature 
detail page with the both the ID and the mouse over information.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>For a full description of the methods used,

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the
<a href="hgTables">Table Browser</a>, or combined with other datasets in the
<a href="hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a> tool.
For automated analysis, the genome annotation is stored in
a bigBed file that can be downloaded from
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/wuhCor1/bbi/poranHla">the download server</a>.</p>

<p>
Annotations can
be converted from binary to ASCII text by our command-line tool bigBedToBed.
Instructions for downloading this command can be found on our
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">utilities page</a>.
The tool can also be used to obtain features within a given range without downloading the file,
for example:</p>
<code>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/wuhCor1/bbi/poranHla/CD8-hla1.bb -chrom=NC_045512v2 -start=0 -end=29902 stdout</code>
