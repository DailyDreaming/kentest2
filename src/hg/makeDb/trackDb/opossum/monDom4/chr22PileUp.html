This is a graph of the amount of pile-up alignments we are getting
when monDom4 is aligned to Hg18 on just chr22.  The graph height at
any particular location is a count of the number of different monDom4
alignments overlapping at that chr22 position in Hg18.  There are three
hot spots on Hg18 chr22 with thousands of hits from monDom4.  Namely:

<UL>
<LI> chr22: 15000000 - 16000000 - 25,912 monDom4 aligned pieces
<LI> chr22: 19000000 - 20000000 - 10,524 monDom4 aligned pieces
<LI> chr22: 22000000 - 23000000 - 14,133 monDom4 aligned pieces
</UL>

<P>
It hasn't been measured, but I would expect similar patterns on other
Hg18 chromosomes since our alignment counts on Hg18 are immense.  This
is just a sample from chr22 since it is small and easy to measure.
