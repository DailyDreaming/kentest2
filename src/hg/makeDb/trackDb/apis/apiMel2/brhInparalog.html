<H2>Description</H2>

<P>This track shows gene predictions produced by Evgeny Zdobnov at EMBL, based on 
homology of 
<A HREF="https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniref" TARGET=_BLANK>UniRef50</A>
proteins with the honeybee genomic sequence.</P>


<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>These gene predictions result from a comparison of the <EM>A. mellifera</EM>
genomic sequence with UniRef50 known proteins using tBlastN.  
For each genomic region, the protein most similar to the 
genomic sequence was used for homology-based gene-model prediction with 
FgenSH+.  High confidence orthology relations among candidate predictions 
in different insect species were identified using all-vs-all Smith-Waterman 
comparisons.</P>
