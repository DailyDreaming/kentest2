<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays aligned cDNA clone sequences from the 
<A HREF="http://stemcell.princeton.edu/" TARGET=_blank>Stem Cell Database</A> 
(SCDb) to the mouse genome.  SCDb is the work of the Lemischka and Moore labs 
(Princeton University) and the Stoeckert lab (University of Pennsylvania).</P>
<P>
Multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are 
responsible for the production of at least eight distinct blood cell lineages.
Regulatory mechanisms that are involved in determining the fate of stem cells 
are derived using molecular components of both stem cells and cells making up 
their environment. Elucidation of the pathways and networks that are involved 
requires the identification of these molecular components. This was achieved 
using high throughput DNA sequence analysis of both human and mouse cell lines. 
Clones were derived from subtracted cDNA libraries from HSCs
and an HSC supportive stromal cell line for each species.  </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
In the investigation for HSCs, cDNA libraries from a highly purified
HSC population and from a stem cell-depleted population were utilized 
(see  
<A HREF="http://stemcell.princeton.edu/v1/mat_met.html" TARGET=_blank>Materials
and Methods</A> and Phillips <em>et al</em>., 2000). The HSC library was 
converted into 
single-stranded molecules, and DNA from the stem-cell-depleted library was used 
as a template to synthesize biotinylated RNA. Two successive rounds of
hybridization of the HSC DNA and the non-stem-cell RNA were performed to remove 
DNA not specific to the HSCs. This subtraction step was followed by 
synthesis of the second strand for the remaining single-stranded stem cell DNA, 
and then several rounds of purification of the resulting DNA. Sequences 
present in a stem cell-depleted cell population were subtracted in this 
manner from the HSC libraries to remove &quot;housekeeping&quot; gene 
products and to enrich for transcripts produced by the HSCs. Randomly-selected 
clones were sequenced using a single-pass.</P>
<P>
The sequences were then subjected to 
bioinformatics analyses, including queries of seven public databases: 
SwissProt, Genbank proteins and nucleotides, ESTs, murine and human EST 
contigs and SCDb itself. Additionally, ORF analysis included searches for 
protein motifs (Pfam, Prodom, SMART, Prosite, eMatrix), transmembrane helices 
(Tmpred) and signal peptides (SignalP). This information, along with that 
obtained from virtual Northerns, nearest neighbor analysis and PubMed
queries, was used annotate the sequences. Northern 
blots, semi-quantitative PCR and microarray experiments were also performed.
The resulting annotation may be found in the SCDb.</P>
<P>
A similar method was used to investigate the transcripts expressed in the 
HSC supportive stromal cell line (Hackney <em> et al</em>., 2002).   
This track was assembled from blat alignments of SCDb as of 15 July, 2005, to 
the mouse genome (mm6/Mar. 2005) using default blat parameters. </P>

For more information about the construction of the SCDb clone library and to 
access the freely available SCDb, see the 
<A HREF="http://stemcell.princeton.edu/" TARGET=_blank>SCDb home page</A>. 
Computational methods have been employed to extensivly analyze these
sequence sets. The preliminary results of the computational analyses and the 
raw sequences were previously available in the original Stem Cell Database 
(Phillips <em>et al</em>., 2000) and the Stromal Cell Database (StroCDB)
(Hackney <em> et al</em>., 2002). </P>
