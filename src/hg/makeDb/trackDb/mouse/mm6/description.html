The March 2005 mouse (<em>Mus musculus</em>) draft genome data was 
obtained from the Build 34 assembly by NCBI. 

<H3>Sample position queries</H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of a 
sequenced genomic clone, an mRNA or EST or STS marker, or 
a cytological band, a chromosomal coordinate range, or keywords 
from the GenBank description of an mRNA. The following list 
provides examples of various types of position queries for the 
mouse genome. See the

<H3>Assembly Details</H3>
<P>
<!--
This assembly is a composite version in which phase 3 High Throughput Genome 
Sequence (HTGS) was merged with the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium v3 Whole 
Genome Shotgun Assembly (MGSCv3). The assembly was performed by NCBI using a 
&quot;combined&quot; tiling path that was created automatically for the most 
part, but was manually curated in places. This facilitated the placement of 
finished sequence in the context of the MGSCv3 assembly. Draft sequence was not 
included in this build: the slight increase in coverage gained by using this 
would have been offset by the increase in build errors. 
<P>
-->
Build 34 includes approximately 2.6 Gb of sequence, of which about
1.9 Gb is finished sequence, contained in 
chromosomes 1-19, X, Y, M (mitochondrial DNA) and Un (unmapped clone contigs).
Chromosomes 2, 4, 11 and X are finished in Build 34. 
More information about this version is available on the NCBI 
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001635.13/"
TARGET=_blank>Build 34 Data</A> web page. </P>
<P>
NOTE: In the Genome Browser mm6 assembly, chrY_random erroneously contains a 
region duplicated from chrY. For more information about this issue, see the 
Genome Browser <A HREF="../FAQ/FAQdownloads#download30">FAQ</A>. Please also 
note that the UCSC mm6 database contains only the reference strain C57BL/6J.
</P>
<!--The whole genome N50 for Build 34 is 22.3 Mb, in 
comparison to 17.7 Mb for the previous build.

Browser <A HREF="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm6/">FTP server</A> or

The mm6 annotation tracks were generated by UCSC and 
collaborators worldwide. See the
