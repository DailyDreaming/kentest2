<h2>Project Organization</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
The BayGenomics project is organized into nine components involving
three institutions: The <a href="http://gladstone.ucsf.edu/gicd/">J.
David Gladstone Institute for Cardiovascular Disease</a>, the <a
href="http://www.ucsf.edu/">University of California, San Francisco</a>
(UCSF), and the <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">University of
California at Berkeley</a> (UCB). Each component of this <a
href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/pga/">Program for Genomic
Applications</a> (PGA) is making major contributions to the <a
href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/">National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute's</a> (NHLBI) genomics program and help to decipher new genes
that are important for cardiopulmonary disease and development.</p>

<p>
A role of Component 1 is to use gene-trap vectors to inactivate ~2,500 genes
per year in ES cells. All of our "trapped" ES cells are posted on our website
and are distributed for a nominal charge by the NIH/NCRR-sponsored
<a href="http://www.mmrrc.org/">Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center</a>
(MMRRC) to the scientific community for the purpose of producing knockout mice.

<p>
Components 2, 3, and 4 are organized to assess which of the ES cell
clones are involved in cardiopulmonary development and common
cardiopulmonary diseases, thereby increasing the value of our resource
to investigators.  We use computational approaches to gain insight
into expression patterns and to assess functions of novel genes.
In addition, we obtain probes for our "trapped" genes for use in
<i>in situ</i> hybridization experiments to define expression patterns
in development and in specific cardiopulmonary diseases. We also use
microarray studies to define which of the trapped genes might be
important for cardiopulmonary diseases.</p>

<p>
The roles of components 5, 6, and 7 are to select a subset of ES cell
clones determined to be most important to understanding cardiopulmonary
development and disease, and to produce knockout mice for the purpose
of further analysis. Selection of genes for the production of knockout
mice is based on our group's long-standing biological interests
and on the anticipated level of interest in those mice by the broader
research community.</p>

<p>
Component 8 focuses on education aimed at the scientific research
community, especially cardiopulmony investigators.  We conduct periodic
"hands-on" workshops and provide extensive educational material on-line
at the BayGenomics website.</p>

<p>
See <a href="http://baygenomics.ucsf.edu/overview/aims.html">Specific Aims</a> for additional
information on the goals of each component.</p>
