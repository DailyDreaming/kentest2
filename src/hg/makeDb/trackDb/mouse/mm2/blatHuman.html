<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track displays alignments of the Dec. 2001 human genome vs.
the mouse genome.</P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The alignments were done with 
<A HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656" TARGET=_blank>blat</A> 
in translated protein mode
using the parameters <em>-q=dnax</em> <em>-t=dnax</em>. The default
settings were used otherwise. Both genomes were masked with 
<A HREF="http://www.repeatmasker.org" TARGET=_blank>RepeatMasker</A> and Tandem Repeat 
Finder before running blat.  Places where more than 250 alignments occurred
over the same place were filtered out.  Beware of alignments of greater than 
97% identity: these may reflect mouse contamination in the human genome or
human contamination in the mouse genome.</P>

<P>This track is produced at UCSC. Mouse sequence data are provided by the 
Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium.
