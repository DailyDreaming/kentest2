Genie gene finding software.  Genie is a generalized HMM 
which accepts constraints based on mRNA and EST data. </P>

<P>
The MGSCv3 genome sequence was partitioned at large assembly gaps into 377
pieces averaging 7MB. mRNAs were aligned to the human genome using pslayout
and only very high stringency alignments were accepted. Alignments were
merged and extended into a set of alternative transcripts (AltMerge). One
alignment was chosen per gene. EST mate pairs that aligned with high
stringency to a common genomic region and agreed in order and orientation
were identified as putative transcribed regions ("clone bounds"). Gene
regions were identified as the maximal overlapping region of AltMerge, clone
bounds, and a statistical ab-initio gene-finder ("Genie"). For each gene
region, one or more transcripts were predicted by a generalized HMM
gene-finder ("AltGenie"). The AltMerge transcript and the clone bounds were
used as constraints to the gene-finder such that scores for states were
modified according to splice, exon, and clone bounds information.
