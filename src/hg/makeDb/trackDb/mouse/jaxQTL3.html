<H2> Description </H2>
<P>
Approximate positions of quantitative trait loci (QTL) based on data released 
by the Jackson Lab <A HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/" 
TARGET = _BLANK>Mouse Genome Informatics database</A> (MGI) on 8 Nov. 2004.
</P>

<H2> Method </H2>
<P>
Most of the QTL records contain an STS marker that exhibits the peak 
logarithm-of-odds (LOD) score for the marker-phenotype association.  
This peak marker is represented by a thick (tall) bar.  
For records that have two flanking STS markers (with or without peak
LOD score data), the QTL region is represented by a thinner bar spanning the 
interval between the two markers.  
Where both flanking markers and peak LOD score are available, the thick bar is
superimposed upon the thinner bar.</P>
