<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the location of the consensus sequences used for the 
selection of probes on the Affymetrix Mouse MOE430 set (A and B) of chips.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Consensus sequences were downloaded from the
<A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=moe430"
TARGET = _BLANK>Affymetrix Product Support</A>
and mapped to the genome with blat followed by pslReps using the parameters
<TT>-minCover=0.3</TT>, <TT>-minAli=0.95</TT> and <TT>-nearTop=0.005</TT>.</P>
