<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The Old UCSC Genes track shows genes from the previous version of
the UCSC Genes build.  This is similar to the current version, but was
done with reference to gene tracks from some older assemblies.
</p>
<P>
Read the current version's <a
href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=mm10&g=knownGene">description page</a>
for more information on how that track was built.

The new release has 63,759 total transcripts, compared with 63,244 in the
previous version. The total number of canonical genes has increased from 32,958
to 33,079. Comparing the new gene set with the previous version:
<ul>
<li>60,827 transcripts did not change.
<li>148 transcripts were not carried forward to the new version.
<li>1,929 transcripts are "compatible" with those in the previous set, meaning that the two transcripts show consistent splicing. In most cases, the old and new transcripts differ in the lengths of their UTRs.
<li>340 transcripts overlap with those in the previous set, but do not show consistent splicing (i.e., they contain overlapping introns with differing splice sites)
</ul>
