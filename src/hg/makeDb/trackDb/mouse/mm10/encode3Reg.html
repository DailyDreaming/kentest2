The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/ENCODE-Project-ENCyclopedia-Of-DNA-Elements">ENCODE project</a> has established an epigenomic resource for mammalian development,
profiling a diverse panel of mouse tissues at multiple developmental stages from 10.5 days post
conception until after birth.</p>
