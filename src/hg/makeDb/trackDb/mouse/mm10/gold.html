<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the assembly
(Dec. 2011, Genome Reference Consortium Mouse Build 38 (GCA_000001635.2))
of the $organism genome.
Whole-genome shotgun reads were assembled into contigs.  When possible, 
contigs were assembled into chromosomes.
The order, orientation and gap sizes between contigs within a chromosome are
based on paired-end read evidence. </P>
<P>
In dense mode, this track depicts the contigs that make up the 
currently viewed chromosome. 
Contig boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Where gaps
exist between contigs, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  When the relative order and orientation of the contigs
within a chromosome is known, a line is drawn in the graphical
display to bridge the blocks.</P>
