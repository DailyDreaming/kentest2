<H2>Description</H2>
This track shows the locations of $organism contigs on the physical map. 
The underlying data is derived from the NCBI <em>seq_contig.md</em> file 
that accompanies this assembly. Although the  NCBI file indicates the 
orientations of the contigs based on how they were assembled into the final 
sequence, all contigs in this track are oriented to the &quot;+&quot; strand. 
<P>
Although this track primarily displays the positions of large clones from the 
mouse reference strain, C57BL/6J, it also shows smaller overlapping contigs from 
alternate strains included in the NCBI data.
