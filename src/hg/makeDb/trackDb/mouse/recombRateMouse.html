<H2>Description</H2> 
<P> The recombination rate track represents calculated sex-averaged
rates of recombination based on either the Whitehead Institute (WI) or
MGD genetic maps.  By default, the WI genetic map rates are displayed.
Female and male specific recombination rates are not available for
these maps.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P> The <A href="http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/mouse/index"
TARGET=_blank>WI Mouse Genetic Map</A> is based on 6,336 genetic
markers with a total of 92 meiotic events.  For more information on
this map, see W.F. Dietrich et. al., &quot;A comprehensive genetic map
of the mouse genome.&quot;, <em>Nature</em>, 380(6570), pages 149-152
(1996).
</P>
<P> The MGD Genetic Map was created at the <A
href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/" TARGET=_blank>Jackson
Laboratory</A>.
</P>
<P> Data for these maps was downloaded from the <A
href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/M_musculus/Mapping_data/"
TARGET=_blank>NCBI ftp site</A>.
<P> Each base is assigned the recombination rate calculated by
assuming a linear genetic distance across the immediately flanking
genetic markers. The recombination rate assigned to each 1 Mb window
is the average recombination rate of the bases contained within the
window.

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>To view a particular map, select the corresponding option from the
&quot;Map Distances&quot; pulldown list. By default, the browser
displays the WI genetic map sex-averaged distances.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>This track is produced at UCSC and uses data that are freely
available for the WI and MGD genetic maps (see above links).  Thanks
to all who have played a part in the creation of these maps. </P>
