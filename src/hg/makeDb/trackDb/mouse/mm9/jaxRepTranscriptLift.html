<H2>Description</H2>
<P><B>***Note***: This track has been mapped from Build 36 (mm8) to 
Build 37 (mm9) using liftOver.</B></P>
<P>
This track shows mappings of sequences chosen as &quot;best
representative transcript&quot; for many highly curated 
<A HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/" TARGET=_BLANK>Mouse Genome 
Informatics</A> (MGI) genes.
Representative transcript identifiers are a concatenation of the
GenBank accession and the MGI gene symbol.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Representative transcript sequences were selected by 
<A HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/" TARGET=_BLANK>MGI</A>.
The sequences were placed on the assembly using 
<A HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656" TARGET=_BLANK>Blat</A> 
and filtered to retain the single best hit.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
Thanks to 
<A HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/" TARGET=_BLANK>MGI</A> 
at The Jackson Laboratory, 
and Bob Sinclair in particular, for providing these data.</P>
