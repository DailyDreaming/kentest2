<H2>Description</H2>

<p>This track is produced as part of the mouse ENCODE Project.
This track shows DNaseI sensitivity measured genome-wide in mouse
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=cellType"> tissues and cell lines</A>
using the Digital DNaseI methodology &#40;see below&#41;, and DNaseI hypersensitive
sites.
DNaseI has long been used to map general chromatin accessibility and
DNaseI hypersensitivity is a universal feature of active
<EM>cis</EM>&#45;regulatory sequences. The use of this method has led
to the discovery of functional regulatory elements that include enhancers,
insulators, promotors, locus control regions and novel elements.
For each experiment &#40;tissue/cell type&#41; this track shows DNaseI sensitivity as a
continuous function using sequencing tag density &#40;<I>Signal</I>&#41;, 
and discrete loci of DNaseI sensitive zones  &#40;<I>HotSpots</I>&#41; and
hypersensitive sites &#40;<I>Peaks</I>&#41;.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<p>
This track is a multi-view composite track that contains multiple data types
(<EM>views</EM>). For each view, there are multiple subtracks that display
individually on the browser. Instructions for configuring multi-view tracks
are <a href="/goldenPath/help/multiView.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
This track contains the following views:
<DL>
<DT><I>HotSpots</I></DT>
<DD> DNaseI sensitive zones identified using the HotSpot algorithm.</DD>
<DT><I>Peaks</I></DT>
<DD> DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHSs) identified as signal peaks within
FDR 1.0% hypersensitive zones.</DD>
<DT><I>Signal</I></DT>
<DD>The density of tags mapping within a 150 bp sliding window
(at a 20 bp step across the genome).</DD>
</DL>
<p>DNaseI sensitivity is shown as the absolute density of <EM>in vivo</EM>
cleavage sites across the genome mapped using the Digital DNaseI methodology
(see below).  Data have been normalized to 25 million reads per cell type.

<H2>Methods</H2>

<p>
Cells were grown according to the approved
<a href="/ENCODE/protocols/cell/mouse" target="_blank">ENCODE cell culture protocols</a>.
Fresh tissues were harvested from mice and the nuclei prepared according 
to the tissue appropriate
<a href="/ENCODE/protocols/cell/mouse" target="_blank">protocol</a>.
Digital DNaseI was performed by DNaseI digestion of intact
nuclei, isolating DNaseI &#39;double-hit&#39; fragments as described in
Sabo <EM>et al.</EM> &#40;2006&#41;, and direct sequencing of fragment
ends &#40;which correspond to <EM>in vivo</EM> DNaseI cleavage sites&#41;
using the Illumina IIx &#40;and Illumina HiSeq by early 2011&#41; platform &#40;36 bp reads&#41;.  
Uniquely mapping high-quality reads
were mapped to the genome using the bowtie aligner.  DNaseI sensitivity is directly reflected in
raw tag density, which is shown in the track as density of tags
mapping within a 150 bp sliding window &#40;at a 20 bp step across the genome&#41;.
DNaseI sensitive zones &#40;<I>HotSpots</I>&#41; were identified using the
HotSpot algorithm
described in Sabo <EM>et al.</EM> &#40;2004&#41;.  1.0&#37; false discovery
rate thresholds &#40;FDR 0.01&#41; were computed for each cell type by
applying the HotSpot algorithm to an equivalent number of random
uniquely mapping 36mers.  DNaseI hypersensitive sites &#40;DHSs or <I>Peaks</I>&#41;
were identified as signal peaks within FDR 1.0&#37; hypersensitive
zones using a peak-finding algorithm &#40;<I>I-max</I>&#41;.</p>

<H2>Verification</H2>

<p>Data were verified by sequencing biological replicates displaying
correlation coefficient &gt;0.9.
