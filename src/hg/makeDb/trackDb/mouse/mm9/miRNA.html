<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The miRNA track shows microRNAs from
<A HREF="https://www.mirbase.org/" TARGET="_blank">miRBase</A>.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The precursor forms of
microRNAs (mirs) in the sense
orientation are shown in black; those in the reverse orientation are colored
grey.</P>
<P>
To display only those items that exceed a specific unnormalized score, enter
a minimum score between 0 and 1000 in the text box at the top of the track 
description page. For this track, a score of 960 signifies that the miRNA is on the + strand and a
score of 480 signifies that it is on the - strand.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Precursor miRNA genomic locations from
<a href="https://www.mirbase.org/" target="_blank">miRBase</a>
were calculated using wublastn for sequence alignment with the requirement of 
100% identity. The extents of the precursor sequences were not generally known,
and were predicted based on base-paired hairpin structure. miRBase is 
described in Griffiths-Jones, S. <EM>et al</EM>. (2006). The miRNA Registry 
is described in Griffiths-Jones, S. (2004) and Weber, M.J. (2005) in the 
References section below.</p>
