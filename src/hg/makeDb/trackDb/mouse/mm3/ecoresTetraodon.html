This track shows Evolutionary Conserved Regions computed by the

Exofish</A> program at <A HREF="http://www.genoscope.cns.fr" TARGET=_BLANK>Genoscope</A>.
Each singleton block corresponds to an "ecore"; two blocks connected by a thin line 
correspond to an "ecotig", a set of colinear ecores in a syntenic region.  

<H3> Methods </H3>
Genome-wide sequence comparisons were done at the protein-coding level between the genome sequences
of mouse, <I>Mus musculus</I>, and Tetraodon, <I>Tetraodon nigroviridis</I>, to detect evolutionarily conserved regions (ECORES).
The sequence versions used in the comparison were 
Mouse (February 2003) and Tetraodon (March 2004).
