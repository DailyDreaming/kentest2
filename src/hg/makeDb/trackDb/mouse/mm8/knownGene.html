<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The UCSC Known Genes track shows known protein-coding genes based on
protein data from UniProt (SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL) and mRNA data from
the NCBI reference sequences collection (RefSeq) and GenBank. 
Each Known Gene is represented by an mRNA and a protein.
<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track follows the display conventions for
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay">gene prediction
tracks</A> with the following color scheme:
<UL>
<LI>Black: indicates the gene has a corresponding entry
in the Protein Databank (PDB).
<LI>DarkBlue: indicates the gene has either a corresponding RefSeq mRNA that is
&quot;Reviewed&quot; or &quot;Validated&quot; or a corresponding Swiss-Prot protein.
<LI>Medium Blue: indicates the gene has a corresponding RefSeq mRNA that is not 
&quot;Reviewed&quot; nor &quot;Validated&quot;.
<LI>Light Blue: everything else. That is, the gene does not have a 
    corresponding Protein Databank entry, RefSeq mRNA, or Swiss-Prot
    protein, but it has supporting evidence of a GenBank mRNA with a
    UniProt (TrEMBL) protein.
</UL>
<P>
This track contains an optional codon coloring 
feature that allows users to quickly validate and compare gene predictions.
To display codon colors, select the <em>genomic codons</em> option from the
<em>Color track by codons</em> pull-down menu. Click 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgCodonColoring.html">here</A> for more 
information about this feature. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>This release of UCSC Known Genes was built by a new process, KG II, 
as described below.
<P>
UniProt protein sequences (including alternative splicing isoforms) 
and mRNA sequences from RefSeq and GenBank 
were aligned against the base genome using BLAT. 
RefSeq alignments having a base identity level within 0.1% of the best 
and at least 96% base identity with the genomic sequence were kept.  
GenBank mRNA alignments having a base identity level within 0.2% of 
the best and at least 97% base identity with the genomic sequence were kept.  
Protein alignments having a base identity level within 0.2% of the best and 
at least 80% base identity with the genomic sequence were kept.
<P>Then the genomic mRNA and protein alignments were compared, 
and protein-mRNA pairings were determined from their overlaps. 
mRNA CDS data were obtained from RefSeq and GenBank data 
and supplemented by CDS structures derived from UCSC protein-mRNA BLAT alignments. 
The initial set of UCSC Known Genes candidates consists of 
all protein-mRNA pairs with valid mRNA CDS structures.  
A gene-check program (similar to the one used for the Consensus CDS (CCDS) project) 
is used to remove questionable candidates, such as those with in-frame stop codons, 
missing start or stop codons, etc.
<P>From each group of gene candidates that share the same CDS structure, 
the protein-mRNA pair having the best ranking and protein-mRNA alignment score 
is selected as a UCSC Known Gene.  
The ranking of a gene candidate depends on its gene-check quality measures.  
When all else is equal, 
a preference is given to RefSeq mRNAs and next to MGC mRNAs.  
Similarly a preference is given to gene candidates represented by Swiss-Prot proteins.  
The protein-mRNA alignment score is calculated based on protein to 
mRNA alignment using TBLASTN, plus weighted sub-scores according 
to the date and length of the mRNA.
