<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.

Many of these gaps &mdash; with the
exception of intractable heterochromatic gaps &mdash; may be closed during the
finishing process.

<P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is supported by read pair data, 
it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap. 
</P>
<P>This assembly contains the following types of gaps:
<UL>

<LI><B>Fragment</B> - gaps between the Whole Genome Shotgun contigs of a 
supercontig.  (In this context, a contig is a set of overlapping sequence reads.  
A supercontig is a set of contigs ordered and oriented during the 
Whole Genome Shotgun process using paired-end reads.)
These are represented by one hundred <em>N</em>s  in the assembly.  
<LI><B>Contig</B> - gaps between supercontigs not linked by the fingerprint 
map, but instead by marker data.  (In this context, the &quot;Contig&quot; gap 
type refers to a map contig, not a sequence contig.)  
In general, these are represented by 100 <em>N</em>s  in the assembly for all 
chromosomes except chrUn (concatenation of unplaced supercontigs), where 
gaps of 25 <em>N</em>s  are used. 
<LI><B>Centromere</B> - gaps for centromeres were included when they could be 
reasonably localized.  Only one centromere is located in this assembly on chrZ
and it's represented by 500,000 <em>N</em>s.
