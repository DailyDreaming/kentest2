<P>
This track shows the gaps in the Feb. 2019 $organism genome assembly.
</P>
<P>
Genome assembly procedures are covered in the NCBI
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/basics/"
TARGET=_blank>assembly documentation</A>.<BR>
NCBI also provides
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/2345051"
TARGET="_blank">specific information about this assembly</A>.
</P>
<P>
The definition of the gaps in this assembly is from the
<A HREF="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/rheMac10/bigZips/rheMac10.agp.gz"
TARGET=_blank>AGP file</A> delivered with the sequence.  The NCBI document
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/agp/AGP_Specification/"
TARGET=_blank>AGP Specification</A> describes the format of the AGP file.

<P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is supported by read pair data,
it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a white line is drawn
through the black box representing the gap.
</P>
<P>This assembly contains the following principal types of gaps:
<UL>
<LI><B>contig</B> - gaps between contigs in scaffolds (count: 20; size range: 100 - 50,000 bases)</LI>
<LI><B>centromere</B> - gaps for centromeres are included when they can be reasonably localized (count: 21; size range: 500,000 - 1,000,000 bases)</LI>
<LI><B>scaffold</B> - gaps between scaffolds in chromosome assemblies (count: 203; size range: 13 - 708,319 bases)</LI>
</UL></P>
