<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The Quality Scores track shows the sequencing quality score 
(between 0 and 60) of each base in the assembly.  
The height at each position of the track 
indicates the quality of the base.  
When zoomed out to a large range, the heights reflect the averaged scores.  
Scores of 40 or higher reflect high confidence in the sequence (with an error rate of less than 
1/10,000); scores of 20 or higher reflect reasonable confidence (of working draft 
quality).

of the displayed information. Click the
