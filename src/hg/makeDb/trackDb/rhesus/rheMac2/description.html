<P>
The Jan. 2006 rhesus macaque (<em>Macaca mulatta</em>) 
draft assembly &mdash; v.1.0, Mmul_051212 &mdash; was obtained from the Baylor 
College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center (BCM HGSC). The sequencing 
and assembly of the rhesus macaque genome is a project of the Macaque Genome 
Sequencing Consortium led by the BCM HGSC, in collaboration with the Genome 
Sequencing Center at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and 
the J. Craig Venter Institute Joint Technology Center. For more information
about this assembly, see
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/237568/" TARGET="_blank">
Mmul_051212</A> in the NCBI Assembly database.</P>
<p>
This assembly, rheMac2, is based on the genome of an Indian-origin female. The
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgGateway?db=rheMac3">rheMac3</a> assembly is based on the
genome of a five-year old female originating from the South-West of China.</p>

<H3>Sample position queries</H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of a
sequenced mRNA or EST, a scaffold coordinate range, a gene identifier,
or keywords from the GenBank description of an mRNA.
The following list shows examples of valid position queries for
the rhesus genome.  See the

<H3>Assembly details</H3>
<P>
The groups in the Macaque Genome Sequencing Consortium carried out 
preliminary assemblies of the genome data using different and complementary 
approaches. The resulting data were combined into a single, high-density 
&quot;melded&quot; assembly by a team at J. Craig Venter Institute. 
This collaboration made use of published macaque maps (Rogers, 2006; Murphy, 
2005), the BAC fingerprint map from the Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, 
and the human genome reference sequence.</P>
<P>
Several whole genome shotgun (WGS) libraries, with inserts of 2-4 kb and 10 kb, 
fosmids with ~35 kb inserts, and BACs with 180 kb inserts were used to produce 
the clone-end sequence data. Approximately 20.1 million reads were used in the 
assembly, representing about 14.9 Gb of sequence and about 5.1X coverage of the 
(clonable) macaque genome. 
The assemblers produced a set of contigs and scaffolds. Scaffolds include 
sequence contigs that could be ordered and oriented with respect to each other 
as well as isolated contigs that could not be linked (single contig scaffolds 
or singletons). The N50 of the contigs is 25.7 kb and the N50 of the scaffolds 
is 5.87 Mb. (The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome 
lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer.)
The total length of all contigs is 2.87 Gb. When the gaps between
contigs in scaffolds are included, the total span of the assembly is
3.01 Gb.</P> <!--
<P>
This is a draft sequence and may contain errors; therefore, users should 
exercise caution. Typical errors in draft genome sequences include
misassemblies of repeated sequences, collapses of repeated regions,
and unmerged overlaps (e.g. due to polymorphisms) creating artificial
duplications. However, base accuracy in contigs is usually very high with 
most errors near the ends of contigs. </P>
