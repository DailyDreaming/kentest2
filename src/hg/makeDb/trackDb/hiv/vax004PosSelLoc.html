<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays Positive Selection analysis results (per location) 
of VAX004 HIV-1 gp120 nucleotide sequences.  Each positive selection site is
labeled by the corresponding amino acid of the consensus sequence.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The standard method for detecting adaptive molecular evolution in
protein-coding DNA sequences is through comparison of nonsynonymous
(amino acid changing; <i>d</i><sub>N</sub>) and synonymous
(silent; <i>d</i><sub>S</sub>) substitution rates through the
<i>d</i><sub>N</sub>/<i>d</i><sub>S</sub> ratio [&omega; or acceptance rate].
&omega; measures the difference between both rates based on a codon
substitution model. If an amino acid substitution is neutral, it will be fixed
at the same rate as a synonymous mutation, with &omega; = 1.  If the amino
acid change is deleterious, purifying or negative selection (i.e., natural
selection against deleterious mutations with negative selection coefficients)
will reduce its fixation rate, thus &omega; &lt; 1.  Only when the amino acid
change offers a selective advantage is it fixed at higher rate than a
synonymous mutation, with &omega; &gt; 1.  Therefore, an &omega; ratio
significantly higher than one is convincing evidence for adaptive or
diversifying selection. In the HIV context, this is the
principle means of identifying changes and therefore sites under antigenic
selection and therefore most important in vaccine targets. Here
<i>d</i><sub>N</sub>/<i>d</i><sub>S</sub> ratios in each subtype and
placebo and vaccine samples were compared using methods implemented in
PAML v3.14.  &omega; and the proportion of sites (&rho;) with &omega;
&gt; 1 were estimated under the site-specific models of
Goldman <em>et al</em>. (1994) and Yang (2000).
Tests of positive selection were performed by comparing likelihood scores
(likelihood ratio test) between the M1 (neutral) and M2 (selection) and
between the M7 (beta) and M8 (beta&&omega;) per-site nested models.
More stringent models in PAML (M0) of per-gene selection were also
estimated for comparison. If adaptive selection was identified, we then
applied the Bayesian test developed by Yang <em>et al</em>. and implemented
in PAML to identify the potential sites under diversifying selection as
indicated by a posterior probability &gt; 0.95. Maximum likelihood trees
were estimated for each subtype using PhyML under the best-fit substitution
models. Each analysis was run twice under &omega; = 1.5 and 0.5.
</P>

<P>
Simulations published by Anisimova <em>et al</em>. (2003) and Shriner
<em>et al</em>. (2003) assessed the accuracy and power of the LRT and Bayes
test implemented in PAML in the presence of recombination. General conclusions
from these analyses indicate that excessive recombination (&rho; = 0.01),
like usually observed in HIV sequences, can cause false positives in the Bayes
test and makes the LRT unrealistic as it often mistakes recombination as
evidence for positive selection. The LRT test that compares models M7 and M8
seems to be more robust to recombination and the detection of sites under
positive selection seems to be less affected by recombination.
Nevertheless, a new coalescent model has been recently described that estimates
the <i>d</i><sub>N</sub>/<i>d</i><sub>S</sub> ratio in the presence of
recombination and hence generates simultaneous estimates of &omega; and &rho;
using Bayesian inference (Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2006).
Such a model is implemented in omegaMap and has been
applied to our subtype and vaccine and placebo samples. We ran omegaMap under
a constant model for variation (i.e., all sites are assumed to share common
&omega; and &rho;) and the following parameter settings:
<UL>
<LI>N&#176; orders = 10</LI>
<LI>N&#176; iterations = 10<super>6</super></LI>
<LI>thinning = 100</LI>
<LI>priors = improper inverse</LI>
</UL>
