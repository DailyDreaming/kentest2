<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays InterPro domain protein sequences aligned 
against the $organism genome.
</P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The protein sequences of InterPro domains were obtained from UniProt.
For each InterPro domain, the longest HIV-1 protein sequence was chosen
to represent the domain.  These representative protein sequences were aligned 
to the base genome using BLAT.
