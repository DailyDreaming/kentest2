<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays Protein Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) results of HIV-1 
gp120 protein sequences.  The protein sequences shown are translated from the 
corresponding sequences in the DNA MSA track.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
Pairwise alignments of the sequence from each subject to the $organism 
genome are displayed as a grayscale density plot (in
pack mode) or as a wiggle (in full mode) that indicates alignment quality.
In dense display mode, conservation is shown in grayscale using
darker values to indicate higher levels of overall conservation.</P>
<P>
To choose a set of subjects to view in the MSA display, visit the
<A HREF="../cgi-bin/gsidTable">Table View</A>. If there are no subjects
chosen, the MSA track will display a default set of subjects.</P>
<P>
Checkboxes on the track configuration page allow selection of the
sequence from the chosen subjects to include in the pairwise display.
Configuration buttons are available to select all of the sequences (<EM>Set
all</EM>) or deselect all of the sequences (<EM>Clear all</EM>).
Note that excluding sequences from the pairwise display does not alter the
the conservation score display.</P>
<P>
To view detailed information about the alignments at a specific
position click on the alignment.</P>

<H3>Protein Level</H3>
<P>
When zoomed-in to the protein-level display, the track shows the amino acid 
composition of each alignment, with amino acids in annotated repetitive
elements displayed in lower case. The numbers and symbols on the Gaps
line indicate the lengths of gaps in the $organism sequence at those
alignment positions relative to the longest non-$organism sequence.
If there is sufficient space in the display, the size of the gap is shown.
If the space is insufficient and the gap would cause no frame shift, a
&quot;*&quot; is displayed; otherwise a &quot;+&quot; is displayed.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
HIV-1 gp120 nucleotide sequences were translated into amino acids using 
<A HREF="http://inbio.byu.edu/faculty/dam83/cdm" TARGET=_blank>AlignmentHelper1.2</A> 
and the resulting peptide sequences were then aligned in MAFFT v5.7 
(Katoh et al. 2005). 
</P>
<P>
We applied two local (L-INS-i and E-INS-i) and one global (G-INS-i) iterative 
refinement algorithms. MAFFT also incorporates a BLOSUM62 scoring matrix 
(an empirical matrix calculated from large datasets representing extreme 
protein family diversity) and assumes a fixed frequency for each AA for 
building MSAs; however, the estimated relative rates of changes in this 
matrix may be too general to fit datasets of specific gene families or high 
substitution rates, such as gp120. Hence, here we performed multiple MAFFT 
alignments using both the BLOSUM62 and gp120-specific scorings matrixes and/or 
fixed and variable AA frequencies estimated for the data at hand. Gene-specific 
empirical matrices and AA frequencies based on the VAX004 and LAGB-VAX004 
datasets were generated via the program 
<A HREF="http://matrixgen.sourceforge.net" TARGET=_blank>MATRIXGEN</A>. 
</P>
<P>The quality of the MSA was then compared using the maximum likelihood (ML) 
tree building approach in PhyML (Guindon and Gascuel 2003) under the GTR+G+I 
model. ML trees showing the highest likelihood scores were indicative of 
better alignments. G-INS-i + BLOSUM62 + AA specific frequencies generated 
the trees with the best likelihood scores. 
</P>
<P>Uncertainty in our MSAs was assessed using GBlocks v0.91b (Castresana 2000). 
Ambiguous blocks were selected and removed according to the following 
settings: 
<UL>
 <LI>minimum number of sequences for a conserved position = 517</LI>
 <LI>minimum number of sequences for a flank position = 877</LI>
 <LI>maximum number of contiguous non-conserved positions = 8</LI>
 <LI>minimum length of a block = 10</LI>
 <LI>allowed gap positions = all</LI>
</UL>
These settings generated a conserved MSA of 1,401 sites.
