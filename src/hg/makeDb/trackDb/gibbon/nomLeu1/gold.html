<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the Jan. 2010 <em>Nomascus leucogenys</em> (Northern
White-Cheeked Gibbon) draft assembly
(<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/13975"
TARGET="_blank">NCBI project 13975</A>, GCA_000146795.1)
produced by the Gibbon Genome Sequencing Consortium
(the <A HREF="https://www.genome.wustl.edu/services/sequencing/" TARGET=_blank>Genome Sequencing
Center</A> at Washington University and Baylor College of Medicine
<A HREF="https://www.hgsc.bcm.edu/content/gibbon-genome-project"
TARGET="_blank">Human Genome Sequencing Center</A>).

Whole-genome shotgun reads were assembled into contigs and when possible, 
contigs were grouped into scaffolds (also known as &quot;supercontigs&quot;).
The order, orientation and gap sizes between contigs within a scaffold are
based on paired-end read evidence.</P>
<P>
In dense mode, this track depicts the contigs that make up the currently-viewed
scaffold. Contig boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Where gaps exist between contigs, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  The relative order and orientation of the contigs within a scaffold is always
known; therefore, a line is drawn in the graphical display to bridge the blocks.</P>
<P>
All components within this track are of fragment type &quot;W&quot;
(Whole Genome Shotgun contig).</P>
