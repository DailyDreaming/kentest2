<P>
This track shows the whole genome shotgun (WGS) contigs of the October 2005 
Version 1.0 $organism assembly.
<P>
The genome has been sequenced to 10.6X coverage. It consists of approximately 
690.7 Mb, including gaps, on 24 chromosomes, chr1 - chr24. There are 7,164 
ultracontigs and scaffolds comprised of 36,494 contigs of unplaced
sequence of 118,243,491 bp.  Not all scaffolds are necessarily assembled
into ultracontigs, and not all ultracontigs are necessarily assembled
into chromosomes.

<P>
The medaka mitochondrial sequence is also available as the virtual chromosome 
&quot;chrM&quot;.  (genbank accession: GI:25057156, NC_004387)

This assembly was produced by Institute of Genetics (NIG)
and the Morishita Laboratory, University of Tokyo.
