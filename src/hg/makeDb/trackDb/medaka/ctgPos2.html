<P>
This track shows the whole genome shotgun (WGS) contigs of the April 2006 
Version 1.0 $organism assembly.
<P>
The genome has been sequenced to 10.6X coverage. It consists of approximately 
700.4 Mb (excluding gaps) on 24 chromosomes, chr1 - chr24. There are 7,299 
scaffolds comprised of 36,494 contigs of unplaced sequence of 118,243,491 bp 
(plus 1,021,750 N gap) displayed on the virtual chromosome chrUn.  The contigs 
are spaced with a 10 bp gap, and the scaffold gaps are 100 bp.

<P>
The medaka mitochondrial sequence is also available as the virtual chromosome 
&quot;chrM&quot;.  (genbank accession: NC_004387)

This assembly was produced by Institute of Genetics (NIG)
and the Morishita Laboratory, University of Tokyo.
