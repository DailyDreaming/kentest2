<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts masked sequence as determined by WindowMasker

<H2>Methods</H2>
WindowMasker was operated with the following parameters:
<PRE>
windowmasker -mk_counts true -input oryLat1.fa -output wm_counts
windowmasker -ustat wm_counts -sdust true -input oryLat1.fa -output repeats.bed
</PRE>
The repeats.bed (bed3) file was loaded into the "repeats" table for
this track.
