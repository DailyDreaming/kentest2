<P>
This track shows the Fugu v.4.0 (Oct. 2004) whole genome shotgun assembly
provided by the US DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI). The assembly was
constructed with the JGI assembler, JAZZ, from paired end sequencing
reads produced at JGI, Myriad Genetics, and Celera Genomics, resulting in
a sequence coverage of 8.5X. All reads are plasmid, cosmid, or BAC end
sequences, with the predominant coverage derived from 2 Kb insert plasmids.
This assembly contains 7,213 scaffolds totaling 393 million base pairs.
The largest 125 scaffolds total 196 million base pairs.

<P>
The scaffolds in the display are ordered numerically using the scaffold
numbering provided by JGI. The Genome Browser depicts the Fugu genome as
a single unordered chromosome with 1000 bp scaffold gaps, which are shown
in the Gap track annotation. The scaffolds decrease in size as the scaffold
number increases; scaffold #1 is the largest.
