This track depicts gaps in the assembly of chrUn, the "unordered chromosome"
for this browser. Gaps are represented as black boxes.
This assembly contains a single type of gap:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Contig - gaps between scaffolds. These gaps, represented by 1000
	Ns, are placeholders between scaffolds that were added as part of
	the construction of chrUn. Because the order and orientation
	between the scaffolds is unknown, contig gaps are considered to be
	unbridged.
