<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the draft assembly
(Oct. 2011, Fugu Genome Sequencing Consortium - FUGU5
(NCBI project 1434, GCA_000180615.2))
of the $organism genome.

Whole-genome shotgun reads were assembled into scaffolds.  When possible, 
scaffolds were grouped into chromosomes.  The order, orientation and gap
sizes between scaffolds within a chromosome are based on paired-end read
evidence.</P>

<P>
Please note additional information about his assembly at the

<P>
In dense mode, this track depicts the scaffolds that make up the 
currently viewed chromosome. 
Scaffold boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Where gaps
exist between scaffolds, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  The relative order and orientation of the scaffolds
within a chromosome is always known; therefore, a line is drawn in
the graphical display to bridge the blocks.
</P>

<P>
Approximately 28% of the assembly (109,895,906 bases) has not
been ordered in the assembly and is included in the genome browser
as 6,812 scaffolds with their genbank identifier as their name, for example:

The fugu mitochondrial sequence is also available as the virtual chromosome 
&quot;chrM&quot;<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_004299"
TARGET=_blank>(NC_004299).</A>

<P>
All components within this track are of fragment type &quot;W&quot;: 
Whole Genome Shotgun contig.  The mitochondrial sequence is marked
as fragment type &quot;F&quot;, finished.</P>
