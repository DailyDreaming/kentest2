<P>
This track shows the draft assembly catChrV17e (Dec. 2008, NHGRI/Genome Technology Branch (NCBI project 10703, accession GCA_000001445.1))
of the $organism genome.

<p>
The cat genome assembly used paired-end fosmid ABI 3730 reads to 
add 0.9X coverage  (from 6 other breeds and one wild cat) 
to the cinnamon assembly (1.9X, ANG00000000) and made 2.8X coverage.

In dense mode, this track depicts the contigs that make up the 
currently viewed scaffold. 
Contig boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Where gaps
exist between contigs, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  The relative order and orientation of the contigs
within a scaffold is always known; therefore, a line is drawn in the graphical
display to bridge the blocks.</P>
