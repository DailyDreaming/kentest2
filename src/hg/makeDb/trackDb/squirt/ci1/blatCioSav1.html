<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows blat alignments of <em>C. savignyi</em> to the 
<em>$Organism</em> genome. The <em>C. savignyi</em> genome was 
provided by the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard.</P>
<P>
The strand information (+/-) for this track is in two parts.  The
first + or - indicates the orientation of the query sequence whose
translated protein produced the match.  The second + or - indicates the
orientation of the matching translated genomic sequence.  Because the two
orientations of a DNA sequence give different predicted protein sequences,
there are four combinations.  ++ is not the same as --; nor is +- the same
as -+.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track follows the display conventions for 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#PSLDisplay">PSL alignment 
tracks</A>. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The alignments were made with blat in translated protein mode, requiring 
two nearby 4-mer matches to trigger a detailed alignment.  The 
<em>$Organism</em> genome was masked with RepeatMasker and Tandem Repeat 
Finder before running blat. </P>
