<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows gene predictions determined by the Semi-HMM-based Nucleic 
Acid Parser (SNAP), a general purpose gene-finding program written by Ian 
Korf. SNAP is suitable for both eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes. For this 
set of predictions, the gene-finder was trained on gene annotations from the
