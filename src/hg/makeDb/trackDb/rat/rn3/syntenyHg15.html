<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows syntenous (corresponding) regions between human and rat 
chromosomes. The Apr. 2003 (hg15) human assembly was used for this annotation.
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
We passed a 100k non-overlapping window over the genome and,  using the 
<A HREF="http://www.bx.psu.edu/miller_lab/dist/blastz.pdf" TARGET=_blank>blastz</A>
best in rat genome alignments, looked for high-scoring regions with at least 
40% of the bases aligning with the same region in rat. 100k segments were joined 
together if they agreed in direction and were within 500 kb of each other in the 
human genome and within 4 Mb of each other in the rat.  Gaps were joined between 
syntenic anchors if the bases between two flanking regions agreed with 
synteny (direction and rat location). Finally, we extended the syntenic block to 
include those areas.<p>
