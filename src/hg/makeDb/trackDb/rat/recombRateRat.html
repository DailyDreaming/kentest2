<H2>Description</H2> 
<P> The recombination rate track represents calculated sex-averaged
rates of recombination based on either the SHRSPxBN F2 intercross or
FHHxACI F2 intercross genetic maps.  By default, the SHRSPxBN map
rates are displayed.  Female and male specific recombination rates are
not available for either map.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P> The <a href="http://archive.broadinstitute.org/rat/public/no_frames.html"
TARGET=_blank>SHRSPxBN and FHHxACI F2 intercross genetic maps</A> were
created at the Whitehead Institute For more information on these maps,
see RG Steen et. al., &quot;A high-density integrated genetic linkage
and radiation hybrid map of the laboratory rat.&quot;, <em>Genome
Res.</em>, 9(6):AP1-8 (1999).
<P> Data for these maps was downloaded from the <A
href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/R_norvegicus/Mapping_data/"
TARGET=_blank>NCBI ftp site</A>.
<P> Each base is assigned the recombination rate calculated by
assuming a linear genetic distance across the immediately flanking
genetic markers. The recombination rate assigned to each 1 Mb window
is the average recombination rate of the bases contained within the
window.

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>To view a particular map or gender-specific rate, select the corresponding
option from the &quot;Map Distances&quot; pulldown list. By default, the browser 
displays the SHRSPxBN sex-averaged distances.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>This track is produced at UCSC and uses data that are freely available for
the SHRSPxBN and FHHxACI intercross genetic maps (see above links).  Thanks
to all who have played a part in the creation of these maps. </P>
