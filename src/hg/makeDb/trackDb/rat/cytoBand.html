<H2>Description</H2>
<P>The chromosome band track represents the approximate 
location of bands seen on Giemsa-stained chromosomes 
under conditions where 400 bands are visible across the
entire genome.</P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P> Data are derived from the ideogram file downloaded from the NCBI ftp site
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/R_norvegicus/maps/mapview/.  Band lengths
are estimated based on relative sizes as defined by the International System for
Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN).

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P> We would like to thank NCBI for providing this information.
