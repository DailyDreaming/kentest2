<strong>Description:</strong><br>
The RGD Genes track shows the location of curated genes available in the <a href="http://www.rgd.mcw.edu">Rat
Genome Database</a>. Exons are
shown as blocks, introns as single pixel connecting lines with small arrows indicating
the direction of transcription.
<p><strong>Method</strong><br>
NCBI RefSeq's from curated RGD gene records were aligned against the genome 
using the 
<A HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656" TARGET=_blank>blat</A> 
algorithm. In cases where genes align at more than one location
the best alignment was used. </p>

<p><strong>Credits</strong><br>
The RGD Genes track is produced at UCSC from sequence data generated by the
research community and curated at the <a href="http://www.rgd.mcw.edu">Rat
Genome Database</a> at the Medical College of Wisconsin.<br>
