<H2> Description </H2>
<P>
Instead of clone-by-clone assemblies, the Rat genome assembly is
pieced together from Bactig assemblies, which are reassemblies of the
reads from sets of overlapping skimmed BAC clones, including mapped
whole genome shotgun (WGS) reads.  The assembly process reworks the contigs (splitting some)
and selects them under more stringent criteria than used for the BAC
submissions.</P>
