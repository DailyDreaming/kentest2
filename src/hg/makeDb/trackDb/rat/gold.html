<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows the draft assembly of the $organism genome.
Instead of a clone-by-clone assembly, the Rat genome assembly is pieced
together from Bactig assemblies, which are reassemblies of the reads from
sets of overlapping skimmed BAC clones, including mapped whole genome
shotgun reads. The assembly process reworks the contigs (splitting some)
and selects them under more stringent criteria than are used for the BAC
submissions.</P>
<P>In dense display mode, this track depicts the path through the draft and finished
contigs used to create the assembled sequence. Where gaps
exist in the path, spaces are shown between the blocks.
