<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly (Mar. 2012, RGSC Rnor_5.0 (GCA_000001895.3))
of the $organism genome.
</p>

<p>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track. If the relative order and orientation
of the contigs on either side of the gap are known, it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a
white line is drawn through the black box representing the gap.
</p>

<p>
This assembly contains the following principal types of gaps:
<ul>
<li><b>Contig</b> - Gaps between the scaffolds of a draft clone.
(In this context, a contig is a set of overlapping sequence reads.)</li>
<li><b>Scaffold</b> - Gaps between scaffolds in an assembled chromosome.</li>
<li><b>Other</b> - Sequences of gaps not marked in the assembly AGP files.</li>
</ul>
</p>
