<P>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.  These gaps - with the
exception of intractable heterochromatic gaps - will be closed during the
finishing process. 
</P><P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is known, it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap. 
</P>
<P>This assembly contains the following principal types of gaps:
<UL>
<LI><B>Fragment</B> - gaps between the contigs of a draft clone. 
(In this context, a contig is a set of overlapping sequence reads.)
These are represented by varying numbers of <em>N</em>s in the assembly.
<LI><B>Clone</B> - gaps between bactigs.  These are represented
by 50,000 <em>N</em>s in the assembly.
</UL></P>
