<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the draft assembly of the $organism genome.  This
assembly merges contigs from overlapping clones into longer sequence
contigs.  
</P>
<P>In dense mode, this track depicts the path through the clones 
(aka the golden path) used to create the assembled sequence. 
Clone boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Where gaps
exist in the path, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  If the relative order and orientation of the contigs
between the two blocks is known, a line is drawn to bridge the
blocks.</P>
<P>
All components within this track are of fragment type &quot;W&quot;: 
Whole Genome Shotgun contig.
