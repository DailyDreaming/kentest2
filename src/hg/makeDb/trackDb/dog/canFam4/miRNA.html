<H2>Description</H2>

This track shows the location of micro-RNA predictions made by mirDeep2.

<H2>Methods</H2>

Public micro-RNA-seq samples were combined with novel brain micro-RNA-seq
datasets for a total of 1.3 billion reads. Reads were included if they were
between 20 - 30 bases after adaptor trimming and bowtie alignments of unique
sequences were used for MiRDeep2 analysis and compared to known dog and human
miRNAs in miRBase in order to identify the position of both known and novel
miRNAs.

<H2>Credits</H2>

The miRNA track was produced as a part of GSD_1.0/CanFam4 reference assembly
project by the

of comparative genomics at Uppsala University.  Please cite the paper
