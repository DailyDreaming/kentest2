<H2>Description</H2>

This track shows the alleles of SNPs and indels that were identified
from 27 domestic dogs of 19 breeds. For each locus, the reference allele
was displayed at the top, and the alternative allele was showed in the bottom.

<H2>Methods</H2>

The SNPs and indels were called from 10x Chromium linked-read sequencing data.
10x reads were aligned to the CanFam4 reference with longranger.
Variations were called and QC filtered by using Genome Analysis Toolkit.

<H2>Credits</H2>

The SNP and indels track was produced as a part of GSD_1.0/CanFam4
reference assembly project by the
<A HREF="https://lindbladtohlab.org" target=_blank>Lindblad-Toh group</A>
of comparative genomics at Uppsala University.  Please cite the paper
if you use the data for your research.
