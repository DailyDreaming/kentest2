<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows protein sequences and annotations on them from the <a
href="https://www.uniprot.org/" target="_blank">UniProt/SwissProt</A> database,
mapped to genomic coordinates. 
</p>
<p>
UniProt/SwissProt data has been curated from scientific publications by the UniProt staff,
UniProt/TrEMBL data has been predicted by various computational algorithms.
The annotations are divided into multiple subtracks, based on their &quot;feature type&quot; in UniProt.
The first two subtracks below - one for SwissProt, one for TrEMBL - show the
alignments of protein sequences to the genome, all other tracks below are the protein annotations
mapped through these alignments to the genome.

For consistency and convenience for users of mutation-related tracks,
the subtrack &quot;UniProt/SwissProt Variants&quot; is a copy of the track
&quot;UniProt Variants&quot; in the track group &quot;Phenotype and Literature&quot;, or 
&quot;Variation and Repeats&quot;, depending on the assembly.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
Genomic locations of UniProt/SwissProt annotations are labeled with a short name for
the type of annotation (e.g. &quot;glyco&quot;, &quot;disulf bond&quot;, &quot;Signal peptide&quot;
etc.). A click on them shows the full annotation and provides a link to the UniProt/SwissProt
record for more details. TrEMBL annotations are always shown in 
<span style="color: rgb(0,150,250)"><b>light blue</b></span>, except in the Signal Peptides,
Extracellular Domains, Transmembrane Domains, and Cytoplamsic domains subtracks.</p>

<p>
Mouse over a feature to see the full UniProt annotation comment. For variants, the mouse over will
show the full name of the UniProt disease acronym.
</p>

<p>
The subtracks for domains related to subcellular location are sorted from outside to inside of 
the cell: <span style="color: rgb(255,0,150)"><b>Signal peptide</b></span>, 
<span style="color: rgb(0,150,255)"><b>extracellular</b></span>, <span style="color: rgb(0,150,0)">
<b>transmembrane</b></span>, and <span style="color: rgb(255,150,0)"><b>cytoplasmic</b></span>.
</p>

<p>
In the &quot;UniProt Modifications&quot; track, lipoification sites are highlighted in 
<span style="color: rgb(12,12,120)"><b>dark blue</b></span>, glycosylation sites in 
<span style="color: rgb(0,100,100)"><b>dark green</b></span>, and phosphorylation in 
<span style="color: rgb(200,200,0)"><b>light green</b></span>.</p>

<p>
Duplicate annotations are removed as far as possible: if a TrEMBL annotation
has the same genome position and same feature type, comment, disease and
mutated amino acids as a SwissProt annotation, it is not shown again. Two
annotations mapped through different protein sequence alignments but with the same genome
coordinates are only shown once.  </p>

<p>On the configuration page of this track, you can choose to hide any TrEMBL annotations.
This filter will also hide the UniProt alternative isoform protein sequences because
both types of information are less relevant to most users. Please contact us if you
want more detailed filtering features.</p>

<p>Note that for the human hg38 assembly and SwissProt annotations, there
also is a <a
href="hgTracks?db=hg38&hubUrl=https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/genome_annotation_tracks/UP000005640_9606_hub/hub.txt" target=_blank>public
track hub</a> prepared by UniProt itself, with 
genome annotations maintained by UniProt using their own mapping
method based on those Gencode/Ensembl gene models that are annotated in UniProt
for a given protein. For proteins that differ from the genome, UniProt's mapping method
will, in most cases, map a protein and its annotations to an unexpected location
(see below for details on UCSC's mapping method).</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
Briefly, UniProt protein sequences were aligned to the transcripts associated
with the protein, the top-scoring alignments were retained, and the result was
projected to the genome through a transcript-to-genome alignment.
Depending on the genome, the transcript-genome alignments was either
provided by the source database (NBCI RefSeq), created at UCSC (UCSC RefSeq) or
derived from the transcripts (Ensembl/Augustus).  The transcript set is NCBI
RefSeq for hg38, UCSC RefSeq for hg19 (due to alt/fix haplotype misplacements 
in the NCBI RefSeq set on hg19). For other genomes, RefSeq, Ensembl and Augustus 
are tried, in this order. The resulting protein-genome alignments of this process 
are available in the file formats for liftOver or pslMap from our data archive
(see "Data Access" section below).
</p>

<p>An important step of the mapping process is filtering the alignment from
protein to transcript. Due to differences between the UniProt proteins and the
transcripts and the genome, the best matching transcript is not always the
correct transcript.  Therefore, only for organisms that have a RefSeq transcript track,
proteins are only aligned to the RefSeq transcripts that are annotated
by UniProt for this protein. If no transcripts are annotated on the protein, or
the annotated ones do not exist anymore, but a NCBI Gene ID is annotated,
the RefSeq transcripts for the gene are used.  If no NCBI Gene is annotated,
then the best matching alignment is used. Only a handful of edge cases
(pseudogenes, very recently added proteins) on hg38 remain where the
global transcriptome-wide matches have to be used.  The details page of the
protein alignments shows the transcripts used for the mapping and how
these transcripts were found. There can be multiple transcripts for one
protein, as their coding sequences can be identical or several of them do
not differ by more than 1% in alignment score.
</p>

<p>In other words, when an NCBI or UCSC RefSeq track is used for the mapping and to align a
protein sequence to the correct transcript, we use a three stage process:
<ol>
    <li>If UniProt has annotated a given RefSeq transcript for a given protein
    sequence, the protein is aligned to this transcript. Any difference in the
    version suffix is tolerated in this comparison.  
    <li>If no transcript is annotated or the transcript cannot be found in the
    NCBI/UCSC RefSeq track, the UniProt-annotated NCBI Gene ID is resolved to a
    set of NCBI RefSeq transcript IDs via the most current version of NCBI
    genes tables. Only the top match of the resulting alignments and all
    others within 1% of its score are used for the mapping.
    <li>If no transcript can be found after step (2), the protein is aligned to all transcripts,
    the top match, and all others within 1% of its score are used.
</ol>

<p>This system was designed to resolve the problem of incorrect mappings of
proteins, mostly on hg38, due to differences between the SwissProt
sequences and the genome reference sequence, which has changed since the
proteins were defined. The problem is most pronounced for gene families
composed of either very repetitive or very similar proteins. To make sure that
the alignments always go to the best chromosome location, all _alt and _fix
reference patch sequences are ignored for the alignment, so the patches are
entirely free of UniProt annotations. Please contact us if you have feedback on
this process or example edge cases. We are not aware of a way to evaluate the
results completely and in an automated manner.</p>
<p>
Proteins were aligned to transcripts with TBLASTN, converted to PSL, filtered
with pslReps (93% query coverage, keep alignments within top 1% score), lifted to genome
positions with pslMap and filtered again with pslReps.  UniProt annotations were
obtained from the UniProt XML file.  The UniProt annotations were then mapped to the
genome through the alignment described above using the pslMap program.  This approach
draws heavily on the <A HREF="https://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/LS-SNP/"
TARGET="_BLANK">LS-SNP</A> pipeline by Mark Diekhans.

<h2>Automated data updates and release history</h2>
<p>
This track is automatically updated on an ongoing basis, every 2-3 months.
The current version is always shown on the track details page, it includes the
release of UniProt, the version of the transcript set and a unique MD5 that is
based on the protein sequences, the transcript sequences, the mapping file
between both and the transcript-genome alignment. The exact transcript
that was used for the alignment is shown when clicking a protein alignment
in one of the two alignment tracks.

are available for browsing in the form of the <a

coordinates on protein sequences to genome coordinates. The filenames are
unipToGenome.over.chain.gz and unipToGenomeLift.psl.gz.  </p>
