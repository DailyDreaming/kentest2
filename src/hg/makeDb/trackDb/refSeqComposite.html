<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The NCBI RefSeq Genes composite track shows $organism protein-coding and non-protein-coding
genes taken from the NCBI RNA reference sequences collection (RefSeq). All subtracks use
coordinates provided by RefSeq, except for the <em>UCSC RefSeq</em> track, which UCSC produces by
realigning the RefSeq RNAs to the genome. This realignment may result in occasional differences
between the annotation coordinates provided by UCSC and NCBI. For RNA-seq analysis, we advise
using NCBI aligned tables like RefSeq All or RefSeq Curated. See the 
<a href="#methods">Methods</a> section for more details about how the different tracks were 
created. </p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
This track is a composite track that contains differing data sets.
To show only a selected set of subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks that you wish to 
hide. <b>Note:</b> Not all subtracts are available on all assemblies. </p>

The possible subtracks include:
<dl>
  <dt><em><strong>RefSeq aligned annotations and UCSC alignment of RefSeq annotations
          </strong></em></dt>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <em>RefSeq All</em> &ndash; all curated and predicted annotations provided by 
    RefSeq.</li>
    <li>
    <em>RefSeq Curated</em> &ndash; subset of <em>RefSeq All</em> that includes only those 
    annotations whose accessions begin with NM, NR,  NP or YP. <small>(NP and YP are used only for
    protein-coding genes on the mitochondrion; YP is used for human only.)</small></li>
    <li>
    <em>RefSeq Predicted</em> &ndash; subset of RefSeq All that includes those annotations whose 
    accessions begin with XM or XR.</li>
    <li>
    <em>RefSeq Other</em> &ndash; all other annotations produced by the RefSeq group that 
    do not fit the requirements for inclusion in the <em>RefSeq Curated</em> or the 
    <em>RefSeq Predicted</em> tracks.</li>
    <li>
    <em>RefSeq Alignments</em> &ndash; alignments of RefSeq RNAs to the $organism genome provided
    by the RefSeq group, following the display conventions for
<a href="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#PSLDisplay" target="_blank">PSL tracks</a>.</li>
   <li>
   <em>RefSeq Diffs</em> &ndash; alignment differences between the $organism reference genome(s) 
   and RefSeq transcripts. <small>(Track not currently available for every assembly.)</small>
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>UCSC RefSeq</em> &ndash; annotations generated from UCSC's realignment of RNAs with NM 
    and NR accessions to the $organism genome. This track was previously known as the &quot;RefSeq 
    Genes&quot; track.</li>
   <li>
   <em>RefSeq Select+MANE (subset)</em> &ndash; Subset of RefSeq Curated, transcripts marked as 
   RefSeq Select or MANE Select. 
   A single <em>Select</em> transcript is chosen as representative for each protein-coding gene. 
   This track includes transcripts categorized as MANE, which are further agreed upon as 
   representative by both NCBI RefSeq and Ensembl/GENCODE, and have a 100% identical match 
   to a transcript in the Ensembl annotation. See <a target="_blank" 
   href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/refseq_select/">NCBI RefSeq Select</a>. 
   Note that we provide a separate track, <a 
   target=_blank href="hgTrackUi?g=mane&db=hg38&c=chr22">MANE (hg38)</a>, 
   which contains only the MANE transcripts.
   </li>
   <li>
   <em>RefSeq HGMD (subset)</em> &ndash; Subset of RefSeq Curated, transcripts annotated by the Human
   Gene Mutation Database. This track is only available on the human genomes hg19 and hg38.
   It is the most restricted RefSeq subset, targeting clinical diagnostics.
   </li>
  </ul>
</dl>

<p>
The <em>RefSeq All</em>, <em>RefSeq Curated</em>, <em>RefSeq Predicted</em>, <em>RefSeq HGMD</em>,
<em>RefSeq Select/MANE</em> and <em>UCSC RefSeq</em> tracks follow the display conventions for
<a href="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay"
target="_blank">gene prediction tracks</a>.
The color shading indicates the level of review the RefSeq record has undergone:
predicted (light), provisional (medium), or reviewed (dark), as defined by <a target=_blank href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21091/table/ch18.T.refseq_status_codes/?report=objectonly">RefSeq</a>. </p>

The item labels and codon display properties for features within this track can be configured 
through the check-box controls at the top of the track description page. To adjust the settings 
for an individual subtrack, click the wrench icon next to the track name in the subtrack list .</p>
<ul>   
  <li>
  <strong>Label:</strong> By default, items are labeled by gene name. Click the appropriate Label 
  option to display the accession name or OMIM identifier instead of the gene name, show all or a 
  subset of these labels including the gene name, OMIM identifier and accession names, or turn off 
  the label completely.</li>
  <li>
  <strong>Codon coloring:</strong> This track has an optional codon coloring feature that 
  allows users to quickly validate and compare gene predictions. To display codon colors, select the
  <em>genomic codons</em> option from the <em>Color track by codons</em> pull-down menu. For more 
  information about this feature, go to the <a href="../goldenPath/help/hgCodonColoring.html" 
  target="_blank">Coloring Gene Predictions and Annotations by Codon</a> page.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>RefSeq Diffs</em> track contains five different types of inconsistency between the
reference genome sequence and the RefSeq transcript sequences. The five types of differences are
as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
   <em>mismatch</em> &ndash; aligned but mismatching bases, plus HGVS g. 
       to show the genomic change required to match the transcript and HGVS c./n. 
       to show the transcript change required to match the genome.</li>
  <li>
   <em>short gap</em> &ndash; genomic gaps that are too small to be introns (arbitrary cutoff of
	 &lt; 45 bp), most likely insertions/deletion variants or errors, with HGVS g. and c./n. 
	showing differences.</li>
  <li>
   <em>shift gap</em> &ndash; shortGap items whose placement could be shifted left and/or right on
	the genome due to repetitive sequence, with HGVS c./n. position range of ambiguous region 
	in transcript. Here, thin and thick lines are used -- the thin line shows the span of the
	repetitive sequence, and the thick line shows the rightmost shifted gap.
       </li>
  <li>
   <em>double gap</em> &ndash; genomic gaps that are long enough to be introns but that skip over 
	transcript sequence (invisible in default setting), with HGVS c./n. deletion.</li>
  <li>
   <em>skipped</em> &ndash; sequence at the beginning or end of a transcript that is not aligned to
       the genome
       (invisible in default setting), with HGVS c./n. deletion</li>

</ul>

<small><b>HGVS Terminology </b>(Human Genome Variation Society):

g. = genomic sequence ; c. = coding DNA sequence ; n. = non-coding RNA reference sequence.</small>
</p>

<p>
When reporting HGVS with RefSeq sequences, to make sure that results from
research articles can be mapped to the genome unambiguously, 
please specify the RefSeq annotation release displayed on the transcript's
Genome Browser details page and also the RefSeq transcript ID with version
(e.g. NM_012309.4 not NM_012309).

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Tracks contained in the RefSeq annotation and RefSeq RNA alignment tracks were created at UCSC using 
data from the NCBI RefSeq project. Data files were downloaded from RefSeq in GFF file format and 
converted to the genePred and PSL table formats for display in the Genome Browser. Information about
the NCBI annotation pipeline can be found 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/process/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>The RefSeq Diffs track is generated by UCSC using NCBI's RefSeq RNA alignments.</p>
<p>
The UCSC RefSeq Genes track is constructed using the same methods as previous RefSeq Genes tracks.
RefSeq RNAs were aligned against the $organism genome using BLAT. Those with an alignment of
less than 15% were discarded. When a single RNA aligned in multiple places, the alignment
having the highest base identity was identified. Only alignments having a base identity
level within 0.1% of the best and at least 96% base identity with the genomic sequence were
kept.</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The raw data for these tracks can be accessed in multiple ways. It can be explored interactively 
using the <a href="/goldenPath/help/api.html" target="_blank">REST API</a>,
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables" target="_blank">Table Browser</a> or
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator"
target="_blank">Data Integrator</a>. The tables can also be accessed programmatically through our
<a href="../../goldenPath/help/mysql.html"
target="_blank">public MySQL server</a> or downloaded from our
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/$db/database/"
target="_blank">downloads server</a> for local processing. The previous track versions are available
in the <a href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/archive/$db/ncbiRefSeq/"
target="_blank">archives</a> of our downloads server. You can also access any RefSeq table
entries in JSON format through our <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/api.html">
JSON API</a>.</p>
<p>
The data in the <em>RefSeq Other</em> and <em>RefSeq Diffs</em> tracks are organized in 
<a href="../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1.5" target="_blank">bigBed</a> file format; more
information about accessing the information in this bigBed file can be found
below. The other subtracks are associated with database tables as follows:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format9" target="_blank">genePred</a> format:</dt>
  <ul>
    <li>RefSeq All - <tt>ncbiRefSeq</tt></li>
    <li>RefSeq Curated - <tt>ncbiRefSeqCurated</tt></li>
    <li>RefSeq Predicted - <tt>ncbiRefSeqPredicted</tt></li>
    <li>RefSeq HGMD - <tt>ncbiRefSeqHgmd</tt></li>
    <li>RefSeq Select+MANE - <tt>ncbiRefSeqSelect</tt></li>
    <li>UCSC RefSeq - <tt>refGene</tt></li>
  </ul>
  <dt><a href="../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format2" target="_blank">PSL</a> format:</dt>
  <ul>	
    <li>RefSeq Alignments - <tt>ncbiRefSeqPsl</tt></li>
  </ul>
</dl>
<p>
The first column of each of these tables is &quot;bin&quot;. This column is designed
to speed up access for display in the Genome Browser, but can be safely ignored in downstream
analysis. You can read more about the bin indexing system
<a href="http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Bin_indexing_system" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>
The annotations in the <em>RefSeqOther</em> and <em>RefSeqDiffs</em> tracks are stored in bigBed 
files, which can be obtained from our downloads server here,
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/ncbiRefSeq/ncbiRefSeqOther.bb"
target="_blank"><tt>ncbiRefSeqOther.bb</tt></a> and 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/ncbiRefSeq/ncbiRefSeqGenomicDiff.bb" 
target="_blank"><tt>ncbiRefSeqDiffs.bb</tt></a>.
Individual regions or the whole set of genome-wide annotations can be obtained using our tool
<tt>bigBedToBed</tt> which can be compiled from the source code or downloaded as a precompiled
binary for your system from the utilities directory linked below. For example, to extract only
annotations in a given region, you could use the following command:</p>
<p>
<tt>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/ncbiRefSeq/ncbiRefSeqOther.bb
-chrom=chr16 -start=34990190 -end=36727467 stdout</tt></p>
<p>
You can download a GTF format version of the RefSeq All table from the 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/$db/bigZips/genes/">GTF downloads directory</a>.
The genePred format tracks can also be converted to GTF format using the
<tt>genePredToGtf</tt> utility, available from the
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/"
target="_blank">utilities directory</a> on the UCSC downloads 
server. The utility can be run from the command line like so:</p>
<tt>genePredToGtf $db ncbiRefSeqPredicted ncbiRefSeqPredicted.gtf</tt>
<p>
Note that using genePredToGtf in this manner accesses our public MySQL server, and you therefore 
must set up your hg.conf as described on the MySQL page linked near the beginning of the Data Access
section.</p>
<p>
A file containing the RNA sequences in <a href="http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph/FASTA.html" 
target="_blank">FASTA</a> format for all items in the <em>RefSeq All</em>, <em>RefSeq Curated</em>, 
and <em>RefSeq Predicted</em> tracks can be found on our downloads server
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/ncbiRefSeq/seqNcbiRefSeq.rna.fa"
