<P>
This track shows the draft assembly (Feb. 2010, ISGC (NCBI project 10703, accession GCA_000005525.1))
of the $organism genome.

The genome has been sequenced to 3X coverage using 454 FLX sequencing.
Contigs were assembled based on alignment to the bovine genome and
ordered into ovine chromosomes using BAC-end sequences and the virtual
sheep genome. See also: <A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/33937"

In dense mode, this track depicts the contigs that make up the 
currently viewed scaffold. 
Contig boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Where gaps
exist between contigs, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  The relative order and orientation of the contigs
within a scaffold is always known; therefore, a line is drawn in the graphical
display to bridge the blocks.</P>
