<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the sequences used in the Oct. 2011 $organism genome assembly.
</P>
<P>
Genome assembly procedures are covered in the NCBI
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/basics/"
TARGET=_blank>assembly documentation.</A><BR>
NCBI also provides
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/328638"
TARGET="_blank">specific information about this assembly.</A>
</P>
<P>
The definition of this assembly is from the
<A HREF="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/triMan1/bigZips/triMan1.agp.gz"
TARGET=_blank>AGP file</A> delivered with the sequence.  The NCBI document
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/agp/AGP_Specification/"
TARGET=_blank>AGP Specification</A> describes the format of the AGP file.

In dense mode, this track depicts the contigs that make up the 
currently viewed scaffold. 
Contig boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Where gaps
exist between contigs, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  The relative order and orientation of the contigs
within a scaffold is always known; therefore, a line is drawn in the graphical
display to bridge the blocks.</P>
