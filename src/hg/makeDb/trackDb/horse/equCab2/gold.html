<P>
This track shows the draft assembly of the $organism genome.  

Whole-genome shotgun reads were assembled into contigs.  When possible, 
contigs were grouped into scaffolds (also known as &quot;supercontigs&quot;)
and then chromosomes.
The order, orientation and gap sizes between contigs within a scaffold are
based on paired-end read evidence. </P>
<P>
This track depicts the contigs that make up the currently viewed chromosome. 
In dense mode, contig boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating
gold and brown coloration. Where gaps
exist between contigs, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  The relative order and orientation of the contigs
within a scaffold is always known; therefore, a line is drawn in the
graphical display to bridge the blocks. Gaps between scaffolds are not
bridged.</P>
<P>
All components within this track are of fragment type &quot;W&quot;
(Whole Genome Shotgun contig) except for chrM, which is comprised of
fragment type &quot;F&quot; (Finished).</P>
