<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The Modern Human Seq track shows human sequence reads of seven individuals mapped 
to the human genome. The purpose of this track is to put the divergence of the 
Denisova genome into perspective with regard to present-day humans.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
DNA was obtained for each of seven individuals from the CEPH-Human
Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP): HGDP00456 (Mbuti), HGDP00998 (Karitiana
Native American), HGDP00665 (Sardinia), HGDP00491 (Bougainville
Melanesian), HGDP00711 (Cambodian), HGDP01224 (Mongolian) and
HGDP00551 (Papuan). Each library was sequenced on the Illumina Genome
Analyzer IIx using 2x101 + 7 cycles on one flow cell according to the
manufacturer's instructions for multiplex sequencing. The paired-end
reads were aligned
using the <A HREF="http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/"
