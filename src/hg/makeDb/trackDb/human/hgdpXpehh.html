<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows per-continent Cross Population Extended Haplotype
Homozygosity (XP-EHH) score (Sabeti <em>et al.</em>), an estimate of 
positive selection that highlights SNPs that have approached or 
achieved fixation in a population but remain polymorphic in the human 
population as a whole.
Scores were calculated using SNPs genotyped in 53 populations worldwide by the
<A HREF="https://morrisoninstitute.stanford.edu/" TARGET=_BLANK>Human 
Genome Diversity Project</A> in collaboration with the
<A HREF="https://cephb.fr/en/index.php" TARGET=_BLANK>Centre d'Etude 
du Polymorphisme Humain</A> (HGDP-CEPH).
This track and several others are available from the 
<A HREF="http://hgdp.uchicago.edu/" TARGET=_BLANK>HGDP Selection Browser</A>.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Samples collected by the HGDP-CEPH from 1,043 individuals from around the
world were genotyped for 657,000 SNPs at
<A HREF="https://hagsc.org/hgdp/" TARGET=_BLANK>Stanford</A>.
The 53 populations were divided into seven continental groups: Africa
(Bantu populations only),
Middle East, Europe, South Asia, East Asia, Oceania and the Americas.
Bantu populations in Africa were chosen instead of all African populations
because a more closely related group was desired for comparison with 
other continental groups.
XP-EHH was then calculated for each population group using the program
xpehh
(<A HREF="http://hgdp.uchicago.edu/Software/xpehh.tar.gz"
TARGET=_BLANK>source code available</A>) 
as described in Sabeti <em>et al.</em>
