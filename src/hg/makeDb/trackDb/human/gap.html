<P>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.  These gaps - with the
exception of intractable heterochromatic gaps - will be closed during the
finishing process. </P>
<P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is known, it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap.</P>
<P>
This assembly contains the following principal types of gaps:
<UL>
<LI><B>Fragment</B> - gaps between the contigs of a draft clone. 
(In this context, a contig is a set of overlapping sequence reads.)
These are represented by 100 <em>N</em>s in the assembly, whether or not there
is bridging information.
<LI><B>Clone</B> - gaps between clones in the same map contig.  These are 
represented by 50,000 <em>N</em>s in the assembly if the gap is bridged or 
100,000 <em>N</em>s if it is not.
<LI><B>Contig</B> - gaps between map contigs. These are represented by 200,000
<em>N</em>s in the assembly.
<LI><B>Heterochromatin</B> - gaps from centromeres (3,000,000 <em>N</em>s) or 
other large blocks of heterochromatin (size varies).
</UL></P>
