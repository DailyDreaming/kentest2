<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows 255 regions detected as putative copy number polymorphisms by BAC microarray analysis 
in a population of 55 individuals, 16 of which had previously characterized chromosome abnormalities.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Hybridizations were all performed in duplicate incorporating a dye-reversal using proprietary 1 Mb 
GenomeChip V1.2 Human BAC Arrays consisting of 2,632 BAC clones (Spectral Genomics, Houston, TX). 
The false positive rate was estimated as ~1 clone per 5,264 tested.
