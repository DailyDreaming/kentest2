<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The Old UCSC Genes track shows genes from the previous version of
the UCSC Genes build, which was built with Gencode v22 models.
See the <A HREF="http:../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?c=chrX&g=knownGene">description page</A>
for more information on how the new GENCODE track was built.

The new release has 197,782 total transcripts, compared with 195,178 in the previous version. The total number of canonical genes has increased from 49,534 to 49,948. Comparing the new gene set with the previous version:
<UL>

<LI>193,647 transcripts did not change.
<LI>534 transcripts were not carried forward to the new version.
<LI>997 transcripts are "compatible" with those in the previous set, meaning that the two transcripts show consistent splicing. In most cases, the old and new transcripts differ in the lengths of their UTRs.
<LI>406 transcripts overlap with those in the previous set, but do not show consistent splicing (i.e., they contain overlapping introns with differing splice sites)
