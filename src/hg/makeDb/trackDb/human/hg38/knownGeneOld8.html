<P>
The Old UCSC Genes track shows genes from the previous version of
the UCSC Genes build.  This set was built at UCSC. It is not based
on GENCODE transcripts as the current set is.
See the <A HREF="http:../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?c=chrX&g=knownGene">description page</A>
for more information on how the new GENCODE track was built.

<P>
The new release has 195,178 total transcripts, compared with 104,178 in the previous version. The total number of canonical genes has increased from 48,424 to 49,534. Comparing the new gene set with the previous version:
<UL>

<LI>9,459 transcripts did not change.
<LI>22,088 transcripts were not carried forward to the new version.
<LI>43,681 transcripts are "compatible" with those in the previous set, meaning that the two transcripts show consistent splicing. In most cases, the old and new transcripts differ in the lengths of their UTRs.
<LI>28,950 transcripts overlap with those in the previous set, but do not show consistent splicing (i.e., they contain overlapping introns with differing splice sites)
