<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
These tracks indicate regions with uniquely mappable reads of particular lengths before and after
bisulfite conversion. Both Umap and Bismap tracks contain single-read mappability and multi-read
mappability tracks for four different read lengths: 24 bp, 36 bp, 50 bp, and 100 bp.</p>
<p>
You can use these tracks for many purposes, including filtering unreliable signal from
sequencing assays. The Bismap track can help filter unreliable signal from sequencing assays
involving bisulfite conversion, such as whole-genome bisulfite sequencing or reduced representation
bisulfite sequencing.</p>

<h3>Bismap single-read and multi-read mappability</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><em>Bismap single-read mappability</em></dt> 
    <dd>
    <p>These tracks mark any region of the bisulfite-converted genome that is uniquely mappable by
    at least one <i>k</i>-mer on the specified strand. Mappability of the forward strand was
    generated by converting all instances of cytosine to thymine. Similarly, mappability of the
    reverse strand was generated by converting all instances of guanine to adenine.</p>
    <p>To calculate the single-read mappability, you must find the overlap of a given region with
    the region that is uniquely mappable on both strands. Regions not uniquely mappable on both
    strands or have a low multi-read mappability might bias the downstream analysis.</p></dd>
  <dt><em>Bismap multi-read mappability</em></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>These tracks represent the probability that a randomly selected <i>k</i>-mer which overlaps
    with a given position is uniquely mappable. Multi-read mappability track is calculated for
    <i>k</i>-mers that are uniquely mappable on both strands, and thus there is no strand
    specification.</p></dd>

<h3>Umap single-read and multi-read mappability</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><em>Umap single-read mappability</em></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>These tracks mark any region of the genome that is uniquely mappable by at least one
    <i>k</i>-mer. To calculate the single-read mappability, you must find the overlap of a given
    region with this track.</p></dd>
  <dt><em>Umap multi-read mappability</em></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>These tracks represent the probability that a randomly selected <i>k</i>-mer which overlaps
    with a given position is uniquely mappable.</p></dd>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables"
target="_blank">Table Browser</a>, or the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator"
target="_blank">Data Integrator</a>. For automated analysis, genome annotation is stored in a bigBed
or bigWig file that can be downloaded from the
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/hoffmanMappability/" target="_blank">download
server</a>. Individual regions or the whole genome annotation can be obtained using our tool
<em>bigBedToBed</em> or <em>bigWigToWig</em>, which can be compiled from the source code or
downloaded as a precompiled binary for your system. Instructions for downloading source code and
binaries can be found <a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/" target="_blank">here</a>.
The tool can also be used to obtain only features within a given range, for example:</p> 
<tt>bigBedToBed -chrom=chr6 -start=0 -end=1000000
http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/hoffmanMappability/k24.Unique.Mappability.bb stdout</tt>
<br>
<tt>bigWigToWig -chrom=chr6 -start=0 -end=1000000
http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/hoffmanMappability/k24.Umap.MultiTrackMappability.bw
stdout</tt>
