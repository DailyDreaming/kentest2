<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track displays the <em>ENCODE Registry of candidate cis-Regulatory Elements</em> (cCREs) 
in the human genome, a total of 926,535 elements identified and classified by the ENCODE Data 
Analysis Center according to biochemical signatures.
cCREs are the subset of representative DNase hypersensitive sites across ENCODE and
Roadmap Epigenomics samples that are supported 
by either histone modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac) or CTCF-binding data.
The Registry of cCREs is one of the core components of the integrative level of the
ENCODE Encyclopedia of DNA Elements.</p>

<p>
Additional exploration of the cCRE's and underlying raw ENCODE data is provided by the
<a target="_blank" href="https://screen-v2.wenglab.org/">
SCREEN</a>
(Search Candidate cis-Regulatory Elements) web tool,
designed specifically for the Registry, accessible by linkouts from the track details page.
The cCREs identified in the mouse genome are available in a companion track, 
<a target="_blank" href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=mm10&g=encodeCcreCombined">here</a>.</p>

<!--

<p>
The DNase-H3K4me3 elements are those with promoter-like biochemical signature that
are not within 200bp of an annotated TSS.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
All individual DNase hypsersensitive sites (DHSs) identified from 706 DNase-seq experiments
in humans (a total of 93 million sites from 706 experiments) were iteratively clustered
and filtered for the highest signal across all experiments, producing 
representative DHSs (rDHSs), with a total of  2.2 million such sites in human.
The highest signal elements from this set that were also supported by high H3K4me3, H3K27ac 
and/or CTCF ChIP-seq signals were designated cCRE's (a total of 926,535 in human).
</p>
<p>
Classification of cCRE's was performed based on the following criteria:
<ol>
  <li>cCREs with promoter-like signatures (cCRE-PLS) fall within 200 bp of an annotated GENCODE TSS
      and have high DNase and H3K4me3 signals.</li>
  <li>cCREs with enhancer-like signatures (cCRE-ELS) have high DNase and H3K27ac with low H3K4me3
      max-Z score if they are within 200 bp of an annotated TSS. The subset of cCREs-ELS within 2 kb
      of a TSS is denoted proximal (cCRE-pELS), while the remaining subset is denoted distal
      (cCRE-dELS).</li>
  <li>DNase-H3K4me3 cCREs have high H3K4me3 max-Z scores but low H3K27ac max-Z scores and do not
      fall within 200 bp of a TSS.</li>
  <li>CTCF-only cCREs have high DNase and CTCF and low H3K4me3 and H3K27ac.</li>
</ol>
