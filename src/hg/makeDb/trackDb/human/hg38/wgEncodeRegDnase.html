<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
These tracks contain the results of DNase I hypersensitivity experiments performed by the
<a href="https://www.gs.washington.edu/faculty/stamj.htm" target="_blank">John Stamatoyannapoulos lab</a>
at the University of Washington from September 2007 to January 2011, as part of the
<a href="../ENCODE" target="_blank">ENCODE project first production phase</a>.
Colors were assigned to cell types based on similarity of signal.
</p>

<p>
Other views of this data (along with additional documentation) are available from the hg19

</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
This track is a composite annotation track containing multiple subtracks, one for each cell type.
The display mode and filtering of each subtrack can be individually controlled. 
For more information about track configuration, see
<a target="_blank" href="../goldenPath/help/multiView.html">Configuring Multi-View Tracks</a>.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Raw sequence data files were processed by the UCSC ENCODE DNase analysis pipeline (July 2014 specification), diagrammed here:

</div>
<p>
Briefly, sequence files were aligned to the hg38 (GRCh38) genome assembly augmented with 'sponge'
sequence (ref).  Multi-mapped reads were removed, as were reads that aligned to 'sponge' or
mitochondiral sequence.  Results from all replicates were pooled, and further processed by
the Hotspot program to call peaks as well as broader regions of activity ('hotspots'), and to
create signal density graphs.
Signal graphs were normalized so the average value genome-wide is 1.
</p>
<p>
The cell types were clustered into a binary tree, a rainbow was cast to the leaf nodes providing coloring based on similarity.

which match the coloring used in their previous versions lifted from the hg19 assembly).
