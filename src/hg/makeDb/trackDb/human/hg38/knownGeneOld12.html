<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The Old UCSC Genes track shows genes from the previous version of
the UCSC Genes build, which was built with GENCODE v32 models.
See the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?c=chrX&g=knownGene">description page</a>
for more information on how the new GENCODE v36 track was built.
</p>
<p>
The new release has 232,184 total transcripts, compared with 247,541 in the previous version. The
total number of canonical genes has decreased from 66,622 to 60,675 . Comparing the new gene set with
the previous version:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    221,698 transcripts did not change.</li>
  <li>
    20,017 transcripts were not carried forward to the new version.</li>
  <li>
    4,860 transcripts are &quot;compatible&quot; with those in the previous set, meaning that the two
    transcripts show consistent splicing. In most cases, the old and new transcripts differ in the
    lengths of their UTRs.</li>
  <li>
    966 transcripts overlap with those in the previous set, but do not show consistent splicing
    (i.e., they contain overlapping introns with differing splice sites)</li>
</ul>
