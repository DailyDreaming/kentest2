<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the differences between the GRCh38 (hg38) and previous GRCh37 (hg19)
human genome assemblies, indicating contigs (or portions of contigs) that are new
to the hg38 assembly.
</P>

<P>
The following color/score key is used:

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The contig coordinates were extracted from the AGP files for both assemblies.
Contigs that matched the same name, same version, and the same specific
portion of sequence in both assemblies were considered identical between the two
assemblies and were excluded from this data set. The remaining contigs are shown
in this track.
