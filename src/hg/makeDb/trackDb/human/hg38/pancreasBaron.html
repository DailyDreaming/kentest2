<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows data from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27667365/"
target="_blank"><em>A Single-Cell Transcriptomic Map of the Human and Mouse
Pancreas Reveals Inter- and Intra-cell Population Structure</em></a>. Pancreas
tissue was analyzed using droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq)
and subsequent clustering distinguished 14 pancreas-resident cell types based
on their identified marker genes found in Baron <em>et al</em>., 2016.</p>

<p>
There are four bar chart tracks in this track collection with pancreas cells
grouped by either batch (<a href="hgTrackUi?g=pancreasBaronBatch">Pancreas Batch</a>),
cell type (<a href="hgTrackUi?g=pancreasBaronCellType">Pancreas Cells</a>), detailed
cell type (<a href="hgTrackUi?g=pancreasBaronDetailedCellType">Pancreas Details</a>) and
donor (<a href="hgTrackUi?g=pancreasBaronDonor">Pancreas Donor</a>). The default track
displayed is pancreas cells grouped by cell type.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
The cell types are colored by which class they belong to according to the following table.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding='2'>
  <thead><tr>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Color</th>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Cell classification</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #0050FF;"></td><td>secretory</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #00C000;"></td><td>endothelial</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #0099C0;"></td><td>epithelial</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #B05020;"></td><td>fibroblast</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
Cells that fall into multiple classes will be colored by blending the colors
associated with those classes. The colors will be purest in the
<a href="hgTrackUi?g=pancreasBaronCellType">Pancreas Cells</a>
subtrack, where the bars represent relatively pure cell types. They can give an
overview of the cell composition within other categories in other subtracks as
well.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>
<p>
Human islets were obtained from two female cadaveric donors ages 51 (human2)
and 59 (human4) and two male cadaveric donors ages 17 (human1) and 38 (human3).
The samples collected from human 1-3 were non-diabetic and human 4 had type 2
diabetes mellitus. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing ~10,000 human pancreatic
cells were isolated and sequenced. For each donor, several separate batches of
~800 cells were prepared and sequenced to obtain an average of about 100,000
reads per cell. Cells were barcoded using the inDrop platform which follows the
CEL-Seq protocol for library construction. Paired end sequencing was done on
the Illumina Hiseq 2500. After filtering out cells with limited numbers of
detected genes, the dataset contained 8,629 cells from the four donors.</p>

<p>
The cell/gene matrix and cell-level metadata was downloaded from the 
<a href="http://cells.ucsc.edu/?ds=human-pancreas" target="_blank">UCSC Cell Browser</a>.
The UCSC command line utility matrixClusterColumns, matrixToBarChart, and bedToBigBed were used
to transform these into a bar chart format bigBed file that can be visualized. The coloring 
was done by defining colors for the broad level cell classes and then using another UCSC utility,
hcaColorCells, to interpolate the colors across all cell types. The UCSC utilities can be found on
<a href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads"
