OMIM is intended for use primarily by physicians and other
professionals concerned with genetic disorders, by genetics researchers, and
by advanced students in science and medicine. While the OMIM database is
open to the public, users seeking information about a personal medical or
genetic condition are urged to consult with a qualified physician for
diagnosis and for answers to personal questions.  Further, please be
sure to click through to <a href = "https://omim.org/"
target="_blank">omim.org</a> for the very latest, as they are continually 
updating data.</p>

<P>OMIM is a compendium of human genes and genetic phenotypes. The full-text,
referenced overviews in OMIM contain information on all known Mendelian
disorders and over 12,000 genes. OMIM is authored and edited at the
McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine, under the direction of Dr. Ada Hamosh.  This database
was initiated in the early 1960s by Dr. Victor A. McKusick as a catalog
of Mendelian traits and disorders, entitled Mendelian Inheritance
in Man (MIM).

<P>
The OMIM data are separated into three separate tracks:
</P>

<P><B>OMIM Alleles </B>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Variants in the OMIM database that have associated 
dbSNP identifiers.  This track is currently unavailable on the hg38 assembly,
as it depends on dbSNP data that has not been released yet.

<P><B>OMIM Genes</B>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The genomic positions of gene entries in the OMIM 
database.  The coloring indicates the associated OMIM phenotype map key.
</P>

<P><B>OMIM Phenotypes - Gene Unknown</B>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regions known to be associated with a phenotype, 
but for which no specific gene is known to be causative. This track 
also includes known multi-gene syndromes.
