<h2> Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows data from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31753849/"
target="_blank"><em>Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals differential
nutrient absorption functions in human intestine</em></a>. Droplet-based
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to survey gene expression
profiles of the epithelium in the human ileum, colon, and rectum. A total of 7
cell clusters were identified: enterocytes (EC), goblet cells (G), paneth-like
cells (PLC), enteroendocrine cells (EEC), progenitor cells (PRO),
transient-amplifying cells (TA) and stem cells (SC).</p>

<p>
This track collection contains two bar chart tracks of RNA expression in colon
cells where cells are grouped by cell type 
(<a href="hgTrackUi?g=colonWangCellType">Colon Cells</a>) or donor 
(<a href="hgTrackUi?g=colonWangDonor">Colon Donor</a>). The default track 
displayed is <a href="hgTrackUi?g=colonWangCellType">Colon Cells</a>.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
The cell types are colored by which class they belong to according to the following table.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding='2'>
  <thead><tr>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Color</th>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Cell classification</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #0099C0;"></td><td>epithelial</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #0050FF;"></td><td>secretory</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #707070;"></td><td>stem cell</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
Cells that fall into multiple classes will be colored by blending the colors associated 
with those classes. Note that the <a href="hgTrackUi?g=colonWangDonor">Colon Donor</a> track 
is colored by donor for improved clarity.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>
<p>
Using scRNA-seq, RNA profiles of intestinal epithelial cells were obtained for 
4,472 cells from two human colon samples. Tissue samples belonged to a male 
donor age 54 (Colon-1) and a female donor age 67 (Colon-2) both diagnosed with 
Adenocarcinoma. The healthy intestinal mucous membranes used for each sample 
were cut away from the tumor border in surgically removed ascending colon tissue. 
Additionally, the intestinal tissues were washed in Hank's balanced salt solution 
(HBSS) to remove mucus, blood cells, and muscle tissue. The sample was enriched 
for epithelial cells through centrifugation before being dissociated with Tryple 
to obtain single-cell suspensions. RNA-seq libraries were prepared using 10x 
Genomics 3' v2 kit and sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq X Ten PE150.</p>

<p>The cell/gene matrix and cell-level metadata was downloaded from the <a
href="http://cells.ucsc.edu/?ds=human-intestine+colon" target="_blank">UCSC Cell Browser</a>.
The UCSC command line utility matrixClusterColumns, matrixToBarChart, and bedToBigBed were used 
to transform these into a bar chart format bigBed file that can be visualized. The coloring 
was done by defining colors for the broad level cell classes and then using another UCSC utility,
hcaColorCells, to interpolate the colors across all cell types. The UCSC utilities can be found on 
<a href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads"
