<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows data from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30348985/" target="_blank">
<em>Single cell RNA sequencing of human liver reveals distinct intrahepatic
macrophage populations</em></a>. Liver tissue was analyzed using droplet-based 
single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and subsequent clustering distinguished 20
hepatic cell populations based on their identified marker genes found in
MacParland <em>et al</em>., 2018.</p>

<p>
There are three bar chart tracks in this track collection with liver cells
grouped by either broad cell type 
(<a href="hgTrackUi?g=liverMacParlandBroadCellType">Liver Broad</a>), specific cell type 
(<a href="hgTrackUi?g=liverMacParlandCellType">Liver Cells</a>) and donor 
(<a href="hgTrackUi?g=liverMacParlandDonor">Liver Donor</a>). The default track displayed is 
<a href="hgTrackUi?g=liverMacParlandCellType">Liver Cells</a>.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
The cell types are colored by which class they belong to according to the following table.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding='2'>
  <thead><tr>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Color</th>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Cell classification</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #F01111;"></td><td>immune</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #00C000;"></td><td>endothelial</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #B05020;"></td><td>fibroblast</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #0099C0;"></td><td>epithelial</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #707070;"></td><td>stem cell</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #6000B0;"></td><td>hepatocyte</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
Cells that fall into multiple classes will be colored by blending the colors associated 
with those classes. The colors will be purest in the 
<a href="hgTrackUi?g=liverMacParlandCellType">Liver Cells</a> subtrack,
where the bars represent relatively pure cell types. They can give an overview
of the cell composition within other categories in other subtracks as well.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>
<p>
Fresh liver samples were taken from 5 neurologically deceased donors (NDD)
deemed acceptable for liver transplantation. The caudate lobe of the liver was
surgically separated and flushed with HTK solution to leave only tissue
resident cells that were used to prepare a cell suspension for scRNA-seq
analysis. Samples were prepared using 10x Genomics 3' v2 library kit and
sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500. A total of 8,444 transcriptional profiles
were obtained for organ specific and non-organ specific cells from healthy
hepatic tissue.</p>

<p>The cell/gene matrix and cell-level metadata was downloaded from the 
<a href="http://cells.ucsc.edu/?ds=human-liver" target="_blank">UCSC Cell Browser</a>.
The UCSC command line utility matrixClusterColumns, matrixToBarChart, and bedToBigBed were used 
to transform these into a bar chart format bigBed file that can be visualized. The coloring 
was done by defining colors for the broad level cell classes and then using another UCSC utility,
hcaColorCells, to interpolate the colors across all cell types. The UCSC utilities can be found on 
<a href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads"
