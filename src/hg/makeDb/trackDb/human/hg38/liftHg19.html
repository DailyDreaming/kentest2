<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows alignments from the hg38 to the hg19 genome assembly, used by the UCSC
<a target="_blank" href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver">liftOver</a> tool and 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/tools/remap" target="_blank">NCBI's ReMap</a>
service, respectively.

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>The track has three subtracks, one for UCSC and two for NCBI alignments.</p>
<p>
The alignments are shown as &quot;chains&quot; of alignable regions. The display is similar to
the other chain tracks, see our 
<a target="_blank" href="/goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#ChainDisplay">
chain display documentation</a> for more information.
</p>


<H2>Data access</H2>
<p>
UCSC liftOver chain files for hg19 to hg38 can be obtained from a dedicated directory on our
<a target="_blank" href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg19/liftOver/">
Download server</a>. The NCBI chain file can be obtained from the
<a target="_blank" href="https://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg38/database/">
MySQL tables directory on our download server</a>, the filename is 'chainHg19ReMap.txt.gz'.
</p>

<p>
Both tables can also be explored interactively with the
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a> or the
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
ReMap 2.2 alignments were downloaded from the 
<a target="_blank" href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/remap/Homo_sapiens/current/">
NCBI FTP site</a> and converted with the UCSC kent command line tools. The UCSC tool chainSwap was
used to swap target and query genome to show the mappings on the hg38 genome. Like all data
processing for the genome browser, the procedure is documented in our
<a target="_blank"
href="https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/src/hg/makeDb/doc/hg19.txt">
hg19 makeDoc file</a>.

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>
Thanks to NCBI for making the ReMap data available and to Angie Hinrichs for the file conversion.
