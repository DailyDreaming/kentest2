Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows data from 
<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.19.452956v2"
target="_blank"><em>The Tabula Sapiens: a multiple organ single cell
transcriptomic atlas of humans</em></a>. The dataset covers ~500,000 cells from
24 human tissues and organs using droplet-based and plate-based single-cell
RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). Samples were taken from the human bladder, blood,
bone marrow, eye, fat, heart, kidney, large intestine, liver, lung, lymph node,
mammary, muscle, pancreas, prostate, salivary gland, skin, small intestine,
spleen, thymus, tongue, trachea, uterus and vasculature. The dataset includes
264,009 immune cells, 102,580 epithelial cells, 32,701 endothelial cells and
81,529 stromal cells.

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
The cell types are colored by which class they belong to according to the following table.
The coloring algorithm allows cells that show some blended characteristics to show blended
colors so there will be some color variation within a class. The colors will be purest in
the <a href="hgTrackUi?g=fetalGeneAtlasCellType">Fetal Cells</a> subtrack, where the bars 
represent relatively pure cell types. They can give an overview of the cell composition 
within other categories in other subtracks as well.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<section> All tissues </section>
<p>
- individual donors (designated TSP 1-15)
- collected 17 tissues from one donor, 14 tissues from a second donor, and 5 tissues from two other donors
- also collected smaller numbers of tissues from a further 11 donors
- mean age of 51 years
- for many tissues the dissociated cells were purified into compartment-level batches (immune, stromal, epithelial and endothelial)</p>
- Sample libraries for all tissues were prepared using both 10x (versions) and SS2

The cell/gene matrix and cell-level metadata was downloaded from the <a
href="http://cells.ucsc.edu/?ds=fetal-gene-atlas+all" target="_blank">
UCSC Cell Browser</a>. The UCSC command line utility matrixClusterColumns,
matrixToBarChart, and bedToBigBed were used to transform these into a bar chart
format bigBed file that can be visualized. The coloring was done by defining
colors for the broad level cell classes and then using another UCSC utility,
hcaColorCells, to interpolate the colors across all cell types.
The UCSC utilities can be found on
