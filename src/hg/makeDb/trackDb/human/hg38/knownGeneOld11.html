<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The Old UCSC Genes track shows genes from the previous version of
the UCSC Genes build, which was built with GENCODE v29 models.
See the <a href="http:../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?c=chrX&g=knownGene">description page</a>
for more information on how the new GENCODE v32 track was built.
</p>
<p>
The new release has 247,541 total transcripts, compared with 226,811 in the previous version. The
total number of canonical genes has increased from 64,792 to 66,622. Comparing the new gene set with
the previous version:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    209,076 transcripts did not change.</li>
  <li>
    195 transcripts were not carried forward to the new version.</li>
  <li>
    16,798 transcripts are &quot;compatible&quot; with those in the previous set, meaning that the two
    transcripts show consistent splicing. In most cases, the old and new transcripts differ in the
    lengths of their UTRs.</li>
  <li>
    751 transcripts overlap with those in the previous set, but do not show consistent splicing
    (i.e., they contain overlapping introns with differing splice sites)</li>
</ul>
