<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track displays data from <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32971526/" target="_blank">
<em>Cells of the adult human heart</em></a>. Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to profile transcriptomes from six regions of the heart:
the interventricular septum (SP), apex (AX), left ventricle (LV), right
ventricle (RV), left atrium (LA), and right atrium (RA). A total of 11 cardiac
cell types were identified along with their marker genes after uniform manifold
approximation and projection (UMAP) embedding of 487,106 cells. Note that the RNA-seq
data is generated using Tag-sequencing (Tag-seq) and does not cover all exons. <p>

<p>
This track collection contains nine bar chart tracks of RNA expression in the
human heart where cells are grouped by cell type 
(<a href="hgTrackUi?g=heartAtlasCellTypes">Heart HCA Cells</a>), age 
(<a href="hgTrackUi?g=heartAtlasAgeGroup">Heart HCA Age</a>), donor 
(<a href="hgTrackUi?g=heartAtlasDonor">Heart HCA Donor</a>), region of the heart 
(<a href="hgTrackUi?g=heartAtlasRegion">Heart HCA Region</a>),
sample (<a href="hgTrackUi?g=heartAtlasSample">Heart HCA Sample</a>), sex 
(<a href="hgTrackUi?g=heartAtlasSex">Heart HCA Sex</a>), source 
(<a href="hgTrackUi?g=heartAtlasSource">Heart HCA Source</a>), cell
state (<a href="hgTrackUi?g=heartAtlasCellStates">Heart HCA State</a>), 
and 10x chemistry version 
(<a href="hgTrackUi?g=heartAtlasVersion">Heart HCA Version</a>). 
The default track displayed is 
<a href="hgTrackUi?g=heartAtlasCellTypes">Heart HCA Cells</a>.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
The cell types are colored by which class they belong to according to the following table.</p>

<table cellpadding='2'>

</p>

<p>
Cells that fall into multiple classes will be colored by blending the colors associated
with those classes. The colors will be purest in the 
<a href="hgTrackUi?g=heartAtlasCellTypes">Heart HCA Cells</a> subtrack, where the 
bars represent relatively pure cell types. They can give an overview of the cell composition 
within other categories in other subtracks as well.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>
<p>
Healthy heart tissues were obtained from 14 UK and North American transplant
organ donors ages 40-75. Tissues were taken from deceased donors after
circulatory death (DCD) and after brain death (DBD). To minimize
transcriptional degradation, heart tissues were stored and transported on ice
until freezing or tissue dissociation. Single nuclei were isolated from
flash-frozen tissue using mechanical homogenization with a glass Dounce tissue
grinder. Fresh heart tissues were enzymatically dissociated and automatically
digested using gentleMACS Octo Dissociator. Next, Hoechst-positive single
nuclei were FACS sorted prior to library preparation. In parallel, Cell
suspensions from fresh heart tissue were enriched for CD45+ cells using MACS LS
columns. Libraries of single cell and single nuclei were prepared using 10x
Genomics 3' v2 or v3. 3' gene expression libraries were sequenced on an
Illumina HiSeq4000 and NextSeq500. In total 45,870 cells, 78,023 CD45+ enriched
cells, and 363,213 nuclei were profiled for 11 major cell types of the heart.</p>

<p>
The cell/gene matrix and cell-level metadata was downloaded from the <a
href="http://cells.ucsc.edu/?ds=heart-cell-atlas" target="_blank">UCSC Cell Browser</a>.
The UCSC command line utility matrixClusterColumns, matrixToBarChart, and bedToBigBed
were used to transform these into a bar chart format bigBed file that can be
visualized. The coloring was done by defining colors for the broad level cell
classes and then using another UCSC utility, hcaColorCells, to interpolate the
colors across all cell types. The UCSC utilities can be found on
