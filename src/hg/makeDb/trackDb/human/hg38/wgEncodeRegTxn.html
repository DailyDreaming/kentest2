<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows transcription levels for several cell types as assayed by high-throughput
sequencing of polyadenylated RNA (RNA-seq).
Additional views of this dataset and additional documentation on the methods used
for this track are available at the
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeCaltechRnaSeq" target="_blank">ENCODE Caltech RNA-seq</a>
page.  The data shown here are derived from the <i>Raw Signal</i> view from the paired 
75-mer 200 bp insert size reads.  The two replicates of the signal were pooled and normalized
so that the total genome-wide signal sums to 10 billion.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
By default, this track uses a transparent overlay method of displaying data from a number of cell
lines in the same vertical space. Each of the cell lines in this track
is associated with a particular color, and these colors are relatively light and saturated so
as to work best with the transparent overlay. The color of these tracks
match their versions from their lifted source on the hg19 assembly. The colors are consistent with the
other hg19 lifted tracks located in the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=wgEncodeReg">ENCODE Regulation</a>
supertrack, with the exception being the DNase tracks, as they were not lifted from hg19 and are
colored to reflect similarity of cell types.

<h2> Data Release Policy </h2>
<p>
Primary ENCODE data produced during the 2007-2012 production phase were subject to a restriction
period.  However, the data here are past those restrictions and are freely available.
The full data release policy for ENCODE is available
<a href="../ENCODE/terms.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
