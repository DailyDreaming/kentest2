<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays the p-values (-log<sub>10</sub>) of the bipolar disorder 
pooled data as reported by the NIMH Genetics Initiative Bipolar Disorder 
Consortium (see References below).  
The Consortium performed a genome-wide asociation study on two populations:
<UL>
<LI>US (European Descent) &mdash; 461 cases in 7 pools, 563 controls in 9 pools</LI>
<LI>German &mdash; 772 cases in 13 pools, 876 controls in 10 pools</LI>
</UL></P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Reported p-values were taken for each of the Illumina550 probes on the genome. 
For visualization purposes, these p-values were logged and negated. 
These p-values have not been Bonferroni adjusted.</P>
<P>  
All of the people in the US population had an affected sibling.  96% of the
people in the German
sample reported that both parents and grandparents were born in Germany.
The German sample was used to replicate the US sample.  The following
conditions were applied to the US sample:
 <UL>
  <LI>pval &lt; 0.05</LI>
  <LI>Odds Ratio &gt; 1.4 or &lt; 0.71</LI>
  <LI>Relative Allele Frequency &gt; 0.05, required to be near a known gene</LI>
  <LI>replicated in the German sample with pval &lt; 0.05</LI>
 </UL>
  
The results left 88 SNPs in 80 genes.  </P>
<P>
When individually genotyped, 76% remained significant in the US sample,
and 36% of those remained significant in the German sample.  Combined p-values
were also calculated for the SNPs yielding the most significant find
rs1012053 p-value = 1.5e-8 for the gene DGKH diacylglyceral kinase,
which is still significant after Bonferroni adjustment. DGKH
protein is key in the lithium-sensitive phosphatidyl inositol pathway.
Several other risk SNPs were identified of small effect.
