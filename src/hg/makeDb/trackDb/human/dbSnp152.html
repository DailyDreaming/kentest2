<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows hundreds of millions of short genetic variants
(up to approximately 50 base pairs) from
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/" target=_blank>dbSNP</A>
build 152:
single-nucleotide variants (SNVs),
small insertions, deletions, and complex deletion/insertions,
relative to the reference genome assembly.
Most variants in dbSNP are rare, not true polymorphisms,
and some variants are known to be pathogenic.
</p><p>
For hg38 (GRCh38), approximately 655 million distinct variants
(RefSNP clusters with rs# ids)
have been mapped to almost 690 million genomic locations
including alternate haplotype and fix patch sequences.
dbSNP remapped variants from hg38 to hg19 (GRCh37);
approximately 645 million distinct variants were mapped to
over 670 million genomic locations
including alternate haplotype and fix patch sequences (not
all of which are included in UCSC's hg19).
