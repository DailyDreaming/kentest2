<H2>Description</H2>

<!--#insert file="omimDescriptionText.html"-->

<P>
This track shows the <B>allelic variants</B> in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
(<A HREF="https://www.omim.org/" TARGET=_blank>OMIM</A>) database that have associated
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/" TARGET=_blank>dbSNP</A> identifiers.
</P>
 
<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<P>Genomic positions of OMIM allelic variants are marked by solid blocks, which appear
as tick marks when zoomed out.  
<P> The details page for each variant displays the allelic variant description, the amino
acid replacement, and the associated
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/" target="_blank">dbSNP</a> and/or
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/" target="_blank">ClinVar</a> identifiers with links to the
variant's details at those resources.
</P>
<P>The descriptions of OMIM entries are shown on the main browser display when Full display
mode is chosen.  In Pack mode, the descriptions are shown when mousing over each entry.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
This track was constructed as follows: 
<UL>
<LI>The OMIM allelic variant data file <TT>mimAV.txt</TT> was obtained from OMIM and
loaded into the MySQL table <TT>omimAv</TT>.
<LI>The genomic position for each allelic variant in <TT>omimAv</TT> with an associated
dbSnp identifier was obtained from the <TT>snp151</TT> table. The OMIM AV identifiers and
their corresponding genomic positions from dbSNP were then loaded into the <TT>omimAvSnp</TT>
table.
</UL>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
Because OMIM has only allowed Data queries within individual chromosomes, no download files are
available from the Genome Browser. Full genome datasets can be downloaded directly from the
<a href="https://omim.org/downloads/" target="_blank">OMIM Downloads page</a>.
All genome-wide downloads are freely available from OMIM after registration.</p>
<p>
If you need the OMIM data in exactly the format of the UCSC Genome Browser,
for example if you are running a UCSC Genome Browser local installation (a partial &quot;mirror&quot;),
please create a user account on omim.org and contact OMIM via
<a href="https://omim.org/contact" target="_blank">https://omim.org/contact</a>. Send them your OMIM
account name and request access to the UCSC Genome Browser 'entitlement'. They will
then grant you access to a MySQL/MariaDB data dump that contains all UCSC
Genome Browser OMIM tables.</p>
<p>
UCSC offers queries within chromosomes from
<a href="hgTables" target=_blank>Table Browser</a> that include a variety
of filtering options and cross-referencing other datasets using our
<a href="hgIntegrator" target=_blank>Data Integrator</a> tool.
UCSC also has an <a href="../goldenPath/help/api.html" target=_blank>API</a>
that can be used to retrieve data in JSON format from a particular chromosome range.</p>
<p>
Please refer to our searchable
<A HREF="https://groups.google.com/a/soe.ucsc.edu/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!search/download+snps"
target=_blank>mailing list archives</a>
for more questions and example queries, or our
<a HREF="../FAQ/FAQdownloads.html#download36" target=_blank>Data Access FAQ</a>
for more information.</p>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
Thanks to OMIM and NCBI for the use of their data. This track was constructed by Fan Hsu,
Robert Kuhn, and Brooke Rhead of the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group.</P>
