<H2> Description </H2>
<P>
Temporal profiling of DNA replication in human ENCODE regions
is displayed as five tracks (0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10), 
corresponding to two-hour intervals of S phase.

<H2> Methods </H2>
<P>
The experimental strategy adopted to map this 
profile involves isolation of replication products from HeLa cells 
synchronized at the G1-S boundary by thymidine-aphidicolin double block 
and released from the block followed by BrdU 
labeling at every two-hour interval of the 10 hrs of S phase. 
The heavy-light DNA representing the pool of DNA replicated during 
each two-hour labeling period was purified by double cesium chloride 
density gradient centrifugation and hybridized to high-density 
genome-tiling Affymetrix array comprised of all unique probes within the 
ENCODE regions. 
<P>
The raw data generated through the microarray experiments was 
processed by computing the enrichment of signal in a particular 
part of S-phase relative to the entirety of S-phase (10hrs).
High confidence (p-value = 1E5) regions of 
replication were mapped by applying the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test in a sliding
window of size 10 kb using the standard Affymetrix data analyses tools
and the April 2003 version of human genome assembly. 
These coordinates were then mapped to the July 2003 assembly by UCSC,
using the liftOver tool.

<H2> Verification </H2>
<P>
The criteria for data verification involve two biological and 
three technical replicates. 
The submitted data is from one biological experimental set.
The tracks will be updated as soon as the results from the second 
biological replicate have been analyzed.
