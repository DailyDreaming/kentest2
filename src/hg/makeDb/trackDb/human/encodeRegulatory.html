ENCODE Regulatory Elements from Boston University.
This track annotates regulatory elements in all ENCODE regions, by combining evidence from multiple
sources.  This track can be used to look for novel promoters.

<H2>Methods</H2>
The lab used Naive Bayes to combine multiple experiments to produce a 
list of regulatory elements. 
</P>



The evidence is listed below. For each input set, the Weng lab
determine a cutoff score at the point of maximum correlation with a well-defined
set of positive and negative examples of promoter regions. They combined the
binarized datasets at the base-pair level using a Naive Bayes setting to produce
a combined score which is binarized at p less than 0.01. Contiguous runs of predicted
positions are clustered.
