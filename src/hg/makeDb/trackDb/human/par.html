<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) are sections of the X and Y chromosomes
that undergo homologous recombination. Genes in these regions are inherited
in the same manner as autosomal genes.  Two PAR regions, PAR1 and PAR2,
have been identified in human.
The pseudoautosomal regions allow the X and Y chromosomes to pair and segregate during
meiosis in males.

<H2>Methods</H2>
The homologous pseudoautosomal regions on human X and Y chromosomes are
assembled using the same clones and are thus identical, haploid sequences.
The coordinates of these regions are provided as part of the assembly.
