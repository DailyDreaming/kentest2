<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
This super-track combines related tracks of ChIP data generated by
the <A HREF="https://molecularbiosci.utexas.edu/component/cobalt/item/16-molecular-biosciences/164-iyer-vishwanath-r?Itemid=1224" TARGET=_blank>Iyer laboratory</A> at 
The University of Texas at Austin.
Two technologies are presented in this super-track: ChIP-chip and ChIP-STAGE.
ChIP-chip, also known as genome-wide location analysis, is a technique for
isolation and identification of DNA sequences bound by specific proteins in
cells. Instead of detecting bound fragments by microarray, ChIP-STAGE uses
Sequence Tag Analysis of Genomic Enrichment, or STAGE, technology by cloning 
STAGE tags, sequencing and mapping to the human genome.
</P>
<P>
These tracks contain ChIP data for several transcription
factors, including c-Myc, E2F4 and STAT1, in cell lines
including 2091 (foreskin fibroblast) and HeLa (cervical carcinoma).
