<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
This super-track combines related tracks of ChIP-chip data 
generated by the Stanford ENCODE group.
ChIP-chip, also known as genome-wide location analysis, is a technique for
isolation and identification of DNA sequences bound by specific proteins in
cells. 
<P>
These tracks contain data for the Sp1 and Sp3 
transcription factors in multiple cell lines,
including HCT116 (colon epithelial carcinoma), 
Jurkat (T-cell lymphoblast), and K562 (myeloid leukemia).

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
The Sp1 and Sp3 data were generated in the
Richard M. Myers lab at Stanford University (now at <a href="https://hudsonalpha.org/myers-lab-researchers-publish-review/" target="_blank">HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology</a>).</P>
