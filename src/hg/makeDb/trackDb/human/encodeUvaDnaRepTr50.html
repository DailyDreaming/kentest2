<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This annotation shows smoothed replication
timing for DNA synthesis as the time of 50% replication (TR<SUB>50</SUB>).</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This annotation follows the display conventions for composite 
tracks. The subtracks within this annotation 
may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects of the 
displayed data. The graphical configuration options are shown at the top of 
the track description page, followed by a list of subtracks.  To display only 
selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The experimental strategy adopted to map this profile involved 
isolation of replication products from HeLa cells synchronized 
at the G1-S boundary by thymidine-aphidicolin double block. Cells 
released from the block were labeled with BrdU at every two-hour 
interval of the 10 hours of S-phase and DNA was isolated from them. 
The heavy-light (H/L) DNA representing the pool of DNA replicated 
during each two-hour labeling period was separated from the unlabeled 
DNA by double cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. The 
purified H/L DNA was then hybridized to a high-density
genome-tiling Affymetrix array comprised of all unique probes within the
ENCODE regions.</P>
<P>
The time of replication of 50% (TR<SUB>50</SUB>) of each microarray probe was
calculated by accumulating the sum over the five time points and
linearly interpolating the time when 50% was reached.  Each probe
was also classified as temporally specific or non-specific based on
whether at least 50% of the accumulated signal appeared in a single
time point or not.</P>
<P>
The TR<SUB>50</SUB> data for all specific probes were then lowess-smoothed within
a 60 kb window to provide the profile displayed in the annotation.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
The replication experiments were completed for two biological sets
in the HeLa adherent cell line.</P>
