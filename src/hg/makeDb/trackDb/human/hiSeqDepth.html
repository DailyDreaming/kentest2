<H1>Description</H1>
<P>
This track displays regions of the reference genome that have exceptionally high
sequence depth, inferred from alignments of short-read sequences from the
<A HREF="https://www.internationalgenome.org/" TARGET="_blank">1000 Genomes Project</A>.
These regions may be caused by collapsed repetitive sequences
in the reference genome assembly; they also have high read depth in assays such as
ChIP-seq, and may trigger false positive calls from peak-calling algorithms.
Excluding these regions from analysis of short-read alignments should reduce
such false positive calls.

<H1>Methods</H1>
<P>
Pickrell <em>et al.</em> downloaded sequencing reads for 57 Yoruba individuals
from the 1000 Genomes Project's low-coverage pilot data, mapped them to the
Mar. 2006 human genome assembly (NCBI36/hg18), computed the read depth for
every base in the genome, and compiled a distribution of read depths.
They then identified contiguous regions where read depth exceeded thresholds
corresponding to the top 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 of the per-base 
read depths, merging regions which fall within 50 bases of each other.
The regions are available for download from
