<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This annotation follows the display conventions for composite 
tracks. The subtracks within this annotation 
may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects of the 
displayed data. The graphical configuration options are shown at the top of 
the track description page, followed by a list of subtracks.  To display only 
selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide. 
For more information about the graphical configuration options, click the

configuration help</A> link.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Chromatin IP was performed as described in Trinklein <em>et
al</em>. (2004).  Amplified and labeled ChIP DNA was hybridized to
oligo tiling arrays produced by NimbleGen, along with a total genomic
reference sample.  The data for each array were median subtracted (log
2 ratios) and normalized (divided by the standard deviation).  
The value given for each probe is 
the transformed mean ratio of ChIP DNA:Total DNA.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Three biological replicates and two technical replicates were
performed.  The Myers lab is currently testing the specificity and
sensitivity using real-time PCR.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
These data were generated in the Richard M. 
Myers lab at Stanford University (now at
<a href="https://hudsonalpha.org/myers-lab-researchers-publish-review/" target="_blank">HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology</a>).</P>
