<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows genomic regions grouped into subsets based on their locations
relative to the transcript-coding and exon-coding regions of Gencode genes.
The data are divided into four region types:
<UL>
<LI><B>Gencode distal intronic:</B> regions between Gencode gene exons that are
located more than 5000 base pairs away from any exon.
<LI><B>Gencode proximal intronic:</B> regions between Gencode gene exons that
are located no more than 5000 base pairs from an exon.
<LI><B>Gencode distal intergenic:</B> regions outside of all Gencode gene
extents that are located more than 5000 base pairs from a gene extent.
<LI><B>Gencode proximal intergenic:</B> regions outside of all Gencode gene
extents that are located within 5000 base pairs of a gene extent.
</UL></P>
<P>
In this context, a <em>gene extent</em> is defined as the region between
transcript start and transcript end.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This annotation track is comprised of subtracks that show
different aspects of the displayed data. The complete list of subtracks
is displayed near the top of the track description page. To display only
selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The Gencode reference gene set is comprised of
the following gene types: <em>Known</em>, <em>Novel_CDS</em>,
<em>Novel_transcript_gencode_conf</em>, and
<em>Putative_gencode_conf</em>.  The exons of this gene set were
extracted using the UCSC Table Browser to define the set of Gencode intronic
regions. Similarly, the transcript start and stop coordinates of this gene set
were extracted to define the Gencode intergenic regions. There is some
ambiguity associated with these classifications due to the presence of isoforms
and overlapping transcripts. </P>
