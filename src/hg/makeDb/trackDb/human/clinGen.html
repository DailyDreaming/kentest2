The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinicalgenome.org"><b>Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen)</b></a>
tracks display data generated from several key curation activities related to <a target="_blank" 
href="https://clinicalgenome.org/curation-activities/gene-disease-validity/"><b>gene-disease validity</b></a>,
<a target="_blank" href="https://clinicalgenome.org/curation-activities/dosage-sensitivity/"
><b>dosage sensitivity</b></a>, and <a target="_blank"
href="https://clinicalgenome.org/curation-activities/variant-pathogenicity/"><b>variant pathogenicity</b></a>.
ClinGen is a <a target="_blank" 
href="https://www.nih.gov/">National Institute of Health (NIH)</a>-funded initiative dedicated to 
identifying clinically relevant genes and variants for use in precision medicine and research. 
This is accomplished by harnessing the data from both research efforts and clinical genetic 
testing and using it to propel expert and machine-driven curation activities. 
ClinGen works closely with the <a target="_blank" 
href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/">National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)</a> of the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/">National Library of Medicine (NLM)</a>
which distributes part of this information through its <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/">ClinVar</a> database.
</p>

<p>
The available data tracks are:
<ul>
<li><b>ClinGen Dosage Sensitivity Map -Haploinsufficiency (ClinGen 
Haploinsufficiency) and -Triplosensitivity (ClinGen Triplosensitivity)</b> -
Shows evidence supporting or refuting haploinsufficiency (loss) and triplosensitivity (gain) as 
mechanisms for disease at gene-level and larger genomic regions.
</li>
<li><b>ClinGen Gene-Disease Validity Classification (ClinGen Validity)</b> -
Provides a semi-qualitative measurement for the strength of evidence of a gene-disease relationship. 
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
A <b>rating system</b> is used to classify the <b>evidence</b> supporting or refuting dosage
 sensitivity for individual genes and regions, which takes in consideration the following criteria:
number of causative variants reported, patterns of inheritance, consistency of phenotype, evidence
from large-scale case-control studies, mutational mechanisms, data from public genome variation 
databases, and expert consensus opinion.
</p>
<p>
The system is intended to be of a &quot;dynamic nature&quot;, with regions being reevaluated periodically to 
incorporate emerging evidence. The evidence collected is displayed within a publicly available 
<a target="_blank" href="https://dosage.clinicalgenome.org/index.shtml">database</a>. 
Evidence that haploinsufficiency or triplosensitivity of a gene is associated with a specific 
phenotype will aid in the interpretive assessment of CNVs including that gene or genomic region.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, a <b>qualitative classification system</b> is used to correlate the <b>evidence</b> of 
a gene-disease relationship: &quot;Definitive&quot;, &quot;Strong&quot;, &quot;Moderate&quot;, 
&quot;Limited&quot;, &quot;Animal Model Only&quot;, 
&quot;No Known Disease Relationship&quot;, &quot;Disputed&quot;, or &quot;Refuted&quot;.
</p>
 
<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<h3>Haploinsufficiency/Triplosensitivity tracks</h3>
<p>
Items are shaded according to dosage sensitivity type, <b><font color="red">red</font></b> 
for haploinsufficiency score 3, <b><font color="blue">blue</font></b> for triplosensitivity score 3, 
and <B><font color="#a8a8a8">grey</font></b> for other evidence scores or 
 not yet evaluated).
Mouseover on items shows the supporting evidence of dosage sensitivity.
Tracks can be filtered according to the supporting evidence of dosage sensitivity.

<p>
<b>Dosage Scores</b> are used to classify the evidence of the supporting dosage sensitivity map:
<dl>
<dd><b>0</b> - no evidence available</dd>
<dd><b>1</b> - little evidence for dosage pathogenicity</dd>
<dd><b>2</b> - some evidence for dosage pathogenicity</dd>
<dd><b>3</b> - sufficient evidence for dosage pathogenicity</dd>
<dd><b>30</b> - gene associated with autosomal recessive phenotype</dd>
<dd><b>40</b> - dosage sensitivity unlikely</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<H3>Gene-Disease Validity track</H3>

<P>
The gene-disease validity classifications are labeled with the disease entity and hovering 
over the features shows the associated gene. Items are color coded based on the strength of their 
classification as provided below:

<P>
The version of the <b>ClinGen Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)</b> that each gene-disease 
classification was performed with is provided as well. An older or newer SOP version does not 
necessarily mean the classification is any more or less valid but is provided for clarity. 
Each details page also contains a direct link to an evidence summary detailing the rationale behind
the specific classification and information such as a breakdown of the semi-qualitative framework, 
relevant PubMed IDs, the type of data (Genetic vs Experimental Evidence), and a detailed summary.
