<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows unique regions in the genome, as identified by the genomic 
alignment of 35-nucleotide segments.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Sequence 'tiles' of 35 nucleotides in length were generated from the genome.
Each tile was aligned to the genome using the BWA aligner.  Tiles that align 
uniquely and perfectly in hg18 receive a p-value of 1e-37, while those that 
align perfectly in multiple locations receive a p-value of 0.  For each tile,
the oligo midpoint coordinate was recorded along with the -log_10 p-value: 
37 (unambiguous) to 0 (ambiguous).
