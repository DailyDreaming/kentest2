<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>This track displays alignments of 16 million mouse whole genome shotgun 
reads (3x coverage) vs. the draft human genome.  The alignments were done 
with BLAT in translated protein mode requiring 7 out of 8 amino acids in a
row to match to trigger a detailed alignment.  The human
genome was masked with RepeatMasker and Tandem Repeat Finder before 
running BLAT.  Places where more than 400 reads aligned were filtered out.
Beware of alignments of greater than 97% identity.  These may reflect
mouse contamination of the human draft, or human contamination of the
mouse shotgun data.</P>
<H2>Data Release Policy</H2>
These data are made available before scientific publication with the 
following understanding:<BR>
1.The data may be freely downloaded, used in analyses, and 
repackaged in databases.<BR>
2.Users are free to use the data in scientific papers analyzing 
particular genes and regions, provided that providers of this data 
(the Mouse Sequencing Consortium) are properly acknowledged.<BR>
3.The Centers producing the data reserve the right to publish the initial 
large-scale analyses of the dataset-including large-scale identification 
of regions of evolutionary conservation and large-scale 
genomic assembly. Large-scale refers to regions with size on the order of 
a chromosome (that is, 30 Mb or more). <BR>
4.Any redistribution of the data should carry this notice.<BR>
