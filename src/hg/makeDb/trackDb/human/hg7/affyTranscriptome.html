<p>Transcriptome data for chromosomes 21 and 22 from <a

"Large-Scale Transcriptional Activity in Chromosomes 21 and 22",
Kapranov, P., Cawley, S. E., Drenkow, J., Bekiranov, S, Strausberg,
R. L., Fodor, S.P.A. and Gingeras, T.R.</a>. In general data presented
is the perfect match - mis-match value. Different experiments were
normalized by setting the average value to be the same for each
chip. Replicates for different cell types were averaged together to
produce the data seen in "full" mode for each cell type. In dense
mode, or at the top in full mode, can be seen the maximum value over
all experiments for that probe called "Transcriptome". The idea being
to paint as many transcribed regions as possible.

<p>To present a more interpretable display when zoomed out averages
have been precalculated over the chromosome at two different
resolutions in addition to the raw data. For example when zoomed out
there may appear to be a peak at the center of a gene rather than a
signal at every exon. Zooming in will reveal the "raw" data for that
region.
