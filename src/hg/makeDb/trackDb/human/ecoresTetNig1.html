<H3> Description </H3>
This track shows Evolutionary Conserved Regions computed by the 
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=10835645&dopt=Abstract" TARGET=_BLANK>
Exofish</A> program at <A HREF="https://jacob.cea.fr/drf/ifrancoisjacob/english/Pages/Departments/Genoscope.aspx" TARGET=_BLANK>Genoscope</A>.
Each singleton block corresponds to an "ecore"; two blocks connected by a thin line 
correspond to an "ecotig", a set of colinear ecores in a syntenic region.  

<H3> Methods </H3>
Genome-wide sequence comparisons were done at the protein-coding level between the genome sequences of human, <I>Homo sapiens</I>, and Tetraodon (green spotted pufferfish), <I>Tetraodon nigroviridis</I>, to detect evolutionarily conserved 
regions (ECORES).
