<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
This track provides information on RNA nucleotides that are edited after transcription and their 
corresponding genomic coordinates. Only post-transcriptional editing that results in small changes 
to the identity of a nucleic acid are included in this track; it does not include other RNA 
processing such as splicing or methylation. The track contains information on A-to-I 
(adenosine-to-inosine) and C-to-U (cytidine-to-uridine) editing that occur due to deamination by 
ADAR and APOBEC enzymes, respectively. Most of the data in this track are on A-to-I editing, which 
is known to be highly abundant in humans.

</ul>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
The data were obtained from several research papers on RNA editing and were mapped to the 
reference genome. More information can be obtained from <a href="https://darned.ucc.ie"
