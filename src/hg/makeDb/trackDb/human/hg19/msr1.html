<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track is powered by the <a
href="http://research.microsoft.com/bionlplab/">MSR BioNLP Lab</a> as part of
<a href="http://literome.azurewebsites.net/">the Literome Project</a> at
Microsoft Research. UCSC collaborators at Microsoft Research (Hoifung Poon,
Chris Quirk) implemented an end-to-end natural-language processing (NLP) system
to extract pathway interactions and processed all 20 million Pubmed abstracts.
The results were mapped to the genome by HGNC gene symbols.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<p>
Pubmed abstracts were retrieved from the NLM website. They were tokenized and
parsed syntactically using the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/msrsplat/">SPLAT
toolkit</a>. Proteins were identified and normalized, and potential
interactions were extracted using the MSR Protein and Pathway Extractors.
