<H2>Description</H2>

<P>These tracks were generated by the 
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="http://www.genome.gov/10005107">ENCODE
Consortium</A>.  They contain information about human RNAs &gt; 200
nucleotides in length that were obtained as short reads from the Illumina GAIIx
platform.  Data are available from biological replicates of several
cell lines.  In addition to profiling Poly-A+ and Poly-A- RNA from
whole cells, there are also data from various subcellular
compartments.  In many cases, there are Cap Analysis of Gene
Expression (CAGE, see the
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeRikenCage">RIKEN CAGE Loc</A> track),
Small RNA-seq (&lt;200 nucleotides, see the
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeCshlShortRnaSeq">CSHL Sm RNA-seq</A> track) and Pair-End
di-TAG-RNA (PET-RNA, see the
<A TARGET=_BLANK
HREF="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeGisRnaPet">GIS RNA PET</A> track) datasets available from the same biological replicates.   

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<P>
This track is a multi-view composite track that contains multiple data types
(<EM>views</EM>).  For each view, there are multiple subtracks that
display individually on the browser.  Instructions for configuring multi-view
tracks are
<A HREF="/goldenPath/help/multiView.html" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.</P>

<p>To show only selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks that
you wish to hide.</p>

<p>Color differences among the views are arbitrary. They provide a
visual cue for
distinguishing between the different cell types and compartments.</p>

<dl>
<dt><i>Contigs</i>
</dt><dd>The Contigs represent blocks of overlapping mapped reads from the pooled biological replicates.
</dd><dt><i>Raw Signals</i>
</dt><dd>The Plus Raw Signal and Minus Raw Signal views show the density of mapped reads on the plus and minus strands (wiggle format), respectively.
</dd>
<dt><i>Alignments</i>
</dt><dd>The Alignments view shows individual reads mapped from biological replicates to the genome and indicates where
bases may mismatch. Every mapped read is displayed, i.e. uncollapsed.  The alignment file follows the standard SAM format of Bowtie output. See the <a href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/manual.shtml#sam-bowtie-output" target=_blank>Bowtie Manual</a> for more information about the SAM Bowtie output (including other tags) and the <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf#page=4" target=_blank>SAM Format Specification</a> for more information on the SAM/BAM file format. 
</dd>
<dt><i>Splice Junctions</i>
</dt><dd>Subset of aligned reads that cross splice junctions.

<H2>Methods</H2>

<H3>Cell Culture</H3>
<P>Cells were grown according to the approved 
<A TARGET=_BLANK
HREF="/ENCODE/protocols/cell/"> ENCODE
cell culture protocols</A>.  
</P>

<H3>Library Preparation</H3>
<P>The published 
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19620212">
cDNA sequencing protocol</A> was used.  This protocol generates directional libraries
and reports the transcripts' strand of origin.  Exogenous RNA spike-ins
<a target="_blank" href="http://sites.google.com/site/rnajunkies/long-rna-seq/nist-spike-in-information">
(Round 5, pool 14)</a>, in development at
National Institutes Standards
Technology, were added to each endogenous RNA isolate and carried
through library construction and sequencing.  The Illumina PhiX
control library was also spiked-in at 1&#37; to each completed human
library just prior to cluster formation.
 Accompanying each RNA-seq dataset is a
&ldquo;Protocol Document,&rdquo; available for download.  This document contains details
about the RNA isolations and treatments, library construction,
spike-ins as well as quality control figures for individual libraries.   
The spike-in sequence and the concentrations are available for download
in the <A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeCshlLongRnaSeq/supplemental/">supplemental directory</A>.
</P>

<H3>Sequencing and Mapping</H3>
<P>The libraries were sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx platform to an
average depth of &#126;200 million reads (100 million mate-pairs).
The data were mapped against hg19 using Spliced Transcript Alignment
and Reconstruction (STAR) written by Alex Dobin (CSHL).  More
information about STAR, including the parameters used for these data,
is available from the
<A TARGET=_BLANK
HREF="http://gingeraslab.cshl.edu/STAR/">Gingeras lab</A>.
</P>

<P>
The following processed
&ldquo;<a target="_BLANK" href="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?tag=Contigs,Junctions,ExonsGencV7,GeneDeNovo,GeneGencV7,TranscriptDeNovo,TranscriptGencV7">elements</a>&rdquo;
data files are available for download.
These elements were assessed for reproducibility using a nonparametric 
irreproducible detection (IDR) rate script.  The IDR values for each element
 are included in the files for end-users to use as a threshold. An IDR value of 0.1 means
 that the probability of detecting that element in a third experiment equivalent 
in depth to the sum of the bioreplicates is 90&#37;.  In addition,
 expression values for annotated genes, transcripts and exons were computed. Further explanation of these 
files is available for download in the
 <A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeCshlLongRnaSeq/supplemental/">supplemental directory</A>.
</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>

<P>
FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped) values were calculated 
for annotated Gencode exons and Spearman values were compared.  
In general, Rho values are &#62; .90 between biological replicates.   
Additional quality control metrics for the samples can be found

<H2>Release Notes</H2>

<P> This is Release 1 (Oct 2011) of this track for hg19. It includes data from the
hg18 releases that has been remapped to hg19 (GM12878 and K562 Total RNA whole 
cell and K562 PolyA+ RNA cytosol) as well as novel data from 13 additional cell
lines and 4 additional cell localizations, as well as some PolyA- samples.  The
signals are now in bigWig format.  The alignments are in BAM format.  The newer
data all have Bio Replicate numbers and Protocol ID numbers that can be used to
link the samples with other experiments. Every experiment has extensive analysis 
and a protocol document available for download only.
