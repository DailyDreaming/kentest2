<h2>Description and display conventions</h2> 

<p><b>NumtS</b> (Nuclear mitochondrial sequences) are mitochondrial fragments inserted in nuclear
genomic sequences. The most credited hypothesis concerning their generation suggests that in presence
of mutagenic agents, or under stress conditions, fragments of mtDNA escape from mitochondria, reach
the nucleus and insert into chromosomes during break repair; although NumtS can also derive from
duplication of genomic fragments. NumtS may be a cause of contamination during human mtDNA sequencing
and hence frequent false low heteroplasmic evidences have been reported.The Bioinformatics group 
chaired by M.Attimonelli (University of Bari, Italy) 
has produced the RHNumtS (Reference Human NumtS) compilation annotating more than 500 Human NumtS. 
To allow the scientific community to access the compilation and to perform genomics comparative 
analyses inclusive of the NumtS data, the group has designed the Human NumtS tracks described below.
</p>

<p>The NumtS tracks show nuclear and mitochondrial regions, the former derived from the application
of the Lift-Over (Galaxy) tool on the High Score Pairs (HSPs) obtained by aligning the mitochondrial
reference genome (NC_012920) with the hg18 release of the human genome then converted to hg19.</p>

<ol> 
	<li><b>"NumtS (Nuclear mitochondrial Sequences)" Track</b> 
	<p>The "NumtS mitochondrial
sequences" track shows the mapping of the HSPs returned by BlastN on the nuclear genome. The shading
of the items reflect the similarity returned by BlastN, and the direction of the arrows is
concordant with the strand of the alignment. For every item, a link pointing to the mitochondrial
mapping is provided, thus allowing a fast cross among the NumtS genomic contexts. </p></li>

	<li><b>"NumtS assembled" Track</b> 
	<p> The "NumtS assembled" track shows items obtained by
assembling HSPs annotated in the "NumtS" track fulfilling the following conditions:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The orientation of their alignments must be concordant.</li> 
			<li>The distance between them must be less than 2 kb, on the mitochondrial genome as 
			well as on the nuclear genome.</li> 
		</ul> 
		
	<p>Exceptions for the second condition arise when a long repetitive element is present between
	two HSPs.</p></li>

	<li><b>"NumtS on mitochondrion" Track</b> 
	<p>The "NumtS on mitochondrion" track shows the mapping
of the HSPs on the mitochondrial genome. The shading of the items reflects the similarity returned
by BlastN, and the direction of the arrows is concordant with the strand of the alignment. For every
item, a link pointing to the nuclear mapping is provided.</p></li>

	<li><b>"Human NumtS on mitochondrion SNP" Track</b> 
	<p>The "Human NumtS SNP" shows the mapping of
the HSPs on the mitochondrial genome, with the SNPs which fall within, derived from the comparison
with the hg19 build. No shading is provided here. For every item, a link pointing to the nuclear
mapping is provided.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Methods</h2> 

<p>NumtS mappings were obtained by running Blast2seq (program: BlastN) between
each chromosome of the Human Genome (hg18 build) and the human mitochondrial reference sequence (rCRS,
AC: NC_012920), fixing the e-value threshold to 1e-03. Mapping coordinates were converted from hg18
to the hg19 assemby by using the Lift-Over software part of Galaxy suite. The assembling of the HSPs 
was performed with spreadsheet interpolation and manual inspection. BED format is used for the first
three annotation tracks, while for the last one the BAM format is implemented. </p>

<h2>Verification</h2> 

<p>NumtS predicted in silico were validated by carrying out PCR amplification
and sequencing on blood-extracted DNA of a healthy individual of European origin. PCR amplification
was successful for 275 NumtS and provided amplicons of the expected length. All PCR fragments were
sequenced on both strands, and submitted to the EMBL databank.</p> 

<p>Furthermore, 541 NumtS were
validated by merging NumtS nuclear coordinates with HapMap annotations. The analysis was
carried on eight HapMap individuals (NA18517, NA18507, NA18956, NA19240, NA18555, NA12878, NA19129,
NA12156). For each sample, clones with a single best concordant placement (according to the fosmid
end-sequence-pair analysis described in Kidd et al., 2008), have been considered. The analysis
showed that 541 NumtS (at least 30bp for each one) had been sequenced in such samples.</p>
