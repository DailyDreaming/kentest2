This track shows the genomic locations of the probesets and probes
from the Affymetrix Exon array.  This array was designed to
interrogate every known and putative exon in the human genome.  For
the design of this array, Affymetrix compiled evidence of expression
from sources including well-annotated genes such as RefSeq, genomic
alignments of mRNA and EST sequences, gene predictions, exon
predictions, and regions that are syntenic to conserved regions in
related species.  Using this evidence, Affymetrix designed a probeset
for each known or putative exon.  While some of these regions might
never be transcribed, the goal is to obtain a comprehensive
measurement of transcription in the human genome.  In most cases, this
array contains one probeset per exon.  However, whenever this
design-time evidence suggested that some exon had alternative splice
sites, the exon was subdivided into two or more regions, and one
probeset was designed for each region (where possible).  The array
contains no probesets for exons smaller than 25 nucleotides.
<P>
The exon array supports both gene-level and exon-level expression
measurement.  When the probesets for a single gene are analyzed
together, it yields results for overall gene expression.  When the
probeset of each exon is contrasted against other exons in the same
gene, it yields results for alternative splicing.
<P>
The probes and probesets on the exon array are divided into five <i>levels</i>
or classes, depending mostly on the degree of design-time evidence.
<UL>

<LI><I>Core</I> probes and probesets are supported by the most
reliable evidence from RefSeq and full-length mRNA GenBank records
containing complete CDS information.

<LI><I>Extended</I> probes and probesets are supported by other cDNA evidence
beyond what is used to support core probe sets. Extended evidence
comes from other Genbank mRNAs not annotated as full-length, EST
sequences, ENSEMBL gene collections, syntenically mapped mRNA from
Mouse, Rat, or Human, mitoMap mitochondrial genes, microRNA registry
genes, vegaGene, and vegaPseudoGene records.

<LI><I>Full</I> probes and probesets are supported by computational
gene prediction evidence only. They are supported by gene and exon
prediction algorithms including GeneID, GenScan, GenScanSubOptimal,
exoniphy, RNAGene, sgpGene and Twinscan.

<LI><I>Free</I> probes and probesets are supported by annotations
which were merged such that no single annotation (or evidence)
contains the probe setprobe sets that are supported by annotations
which were merged such that no single annotation (or evidence)
contains the probe set.

<LI><I>Ambiguous</I> probes and probesets cannot be assigned unambiguously to any
single gene. 
</UL>
All probes and probesets have a two-part label, indicating the <i>transcript 
cluster ID</i> and <i>probeset ID</i>.  The transcript cluster ID is a numeric 
representation of the gene interrogated by the probeset in question.  All probes
are labeled with the transcript cluster ID and probeset ID of whatever probeset
they belong to.
