<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
These tracks display the level of sequence uniqueness of the reference hg19
genome.  They were generated using different window sizes and high signal
will be found in areas where the sequence is unique.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The <em>CRG Alignability</em> tracks shows how uniquely k-mer sequences align
to a region of the genome. To generate the data, sliding windows of k-mers
(where k is 36, 40, 50, 75 or 100 nts) of the human genome sequence were
mapped back to the genome using the GEM mapper aligner allowing 0, 1 or 2 
mismatches. For each window, a mappability score was computed 
(S = 1/(number of bases of match found)).
The <em>CRG Alignability</em> tracks show how uniquely k-mer sequences align 
to a region of the genome. To generate the data, the GEM-mappability 
<A HREF="http://gemlibrary.sourceforge.net" TARGET=_BLANK>program</A> has 
been employed. The method is equivalent to mapping sliding windows of k-mers 
(where k has been set to 36, 40, 50, 75 or 100 nts to produce these tracks) 
back to the genome using the GEM mapper aligner (up to 2 mismatches were 
allowed in this case). For each window, a mappability score was computed 
(S = 1/(number of matches found in the genome): S=1 means exact match, S=0.5 
is two matches, and so on). The <em>CRG Alignability</em> tracks were 
generated independently of the ENCODE project, in the framework of the GEM 
(GEnome Multitool) project.
