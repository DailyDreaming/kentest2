      <LI><em>Note: UCSC has modified the weight of each SNP that has a single
          mapping to the same pseudoautosomal region (PAR) on both chrX and chrY,
	  from 3 to 1.
	  dbSNP agrees that the weight should be 1 and will change its pipeline
	  to detect that case and assign a weight of 1 in the future.<BR>
The Y chromosome in this assembly contains two pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) 
that were taken from the corresponding regions in the X chromosome and are 
exact duplicates:

chrY:10001-2649520 and chrY:59034050-59363566
