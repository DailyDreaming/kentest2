<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
These tracks display evidence of chromatin interactions in ENCODE cell types.
A chromatin interaction is defined as two regions of the genome that are far apart in terms of genomic distance, but are spatially proximate to each other in the 3-dimensional cellular nucleus.
Binding sites are also displayed when a transcription factor is used in the assay.
A binding site is defined as a region of the genome that is highly enriched by specific Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) against a transcription factor, which indicates that the transcription factor binds specifically to this region. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ChIA-PET</span>:
The Chromatin Interaction Analysis with Paired-End Tag (ChIA-PET) (Li 2010, Fullwood 2010) track shows the locations of RNA polymerase II-bound (RNAPII-bound) chromatin interactions determined by Paired-End Tag (PET) sequencing using proximity-ligated chromatin extracts from human cell lines.
The RNAPII ChIA-PET experiment generates RNAPII binding sites. 
Generally, a chromatin interaction is more likely to connect two RNAPII binding sites together. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">5C</span>:
Chromosome Conformation Capture Carbon Copy (5C) (Dostie 2006) maps genomic interactions of a focused set of restriction enzymes. 
The three-dimensional organization of chromosomes and chromatin domains is obtained by cross-linking, digestion, ligation and then detection (Dekker 2002).

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>These are multi-view composite tracks that contains multiple
data types controllable using the 'Select view' function as described <a
 href="/goldenPath/help/multiView.html">here</a>.
Most ENCODE tracks contain multiple subtracks, corresponding to
multiple experimental conditions. If a track contains a large
number of subtracks, only some subtracks will be displayed by default.
The user can select which subtracks are displayed via the display controls
on the track details pages.</p>
<p>Further details on display conventions and data interpretation are available in the subtrack descriptions.</p>

<h2>Credits<br>
</h2>
These data were generated and analyzed as part of the <a
 href="https://www.genome.gov/10005107">ENCODE</a> project, a
genome-wide consortium project with the aim of cataloging all
functional elements in the human genome. This effort includes
collecting a variety of data across related experimental conditions to
facilitate integrative analysis. Consequently, additional ENCODE tracks may 
contain data that is relevant to the data in these tracks. <br>

<P>Data users may freely use ENCODE data, but may not, without prior
consent, submit publications that use an unpublished ENCODE dataset until
nine months following the release of the dataset.  This date is listed in
the <EM>Restricted Until</EM> column on the track configuration page 
and the download page.  The full data release policy
