<H2>Description and Methods </H2>
<P>
This track shows gene annotations from the Vertebrate Genome Annotation (Vega)
database. Annotations are divided into two subtracks from the 
<A HREF="http://vega.archive.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index"
TARGET="_blank">Vega Human Genome Annotation</A> project: 
<UL>
 <LI>Vega Protein-Coding and Non-Coding Gene Annotations
 <LI>Vega Annotated Pseudogenes and Immunoglobulin Segments
</UL>

<P>
&quot;The Vega database
is designed to be a central repository for high-quality, frequently updated
manual annotation of different vertebrate finished genome sequence.
Vega attempts to present consistent high-quality curation of the published
chromosome sequences. Finished genomic sequence is analysed on a
clone-by-clone basis using
a combination of similarity searches against DNA and protein databases
as well as a series of <em>ab initio</em> gene predictions (GENSCAN, Fgenes).
The annotation is based on supporting evidence only.&quot;</P>
<P>
&quot;In addition, comparative analysis using vertebrate datasets such as
the Riken mouse cDNAs and Genoscope <em>Tetraodon nigroviridis</em> Ecores
(Evolutionary Conserved Regions) are used for novel gene discovery.&quot;</P>
