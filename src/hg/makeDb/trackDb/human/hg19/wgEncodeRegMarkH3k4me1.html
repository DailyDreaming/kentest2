<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
Chemical modifications (e.g. methylation and acylation) to the histone proteins
present in chromatin influence gene expression by changing how
accessible the chromatin is to transcription. A specific modification of
a specific histone protein is called a histone mark.
This track shows the levels of enrichment of the H3K4Me1 histone mark across the genome as determined by a
ChIP-seq assay.  The H3K4me1 histone mark is the mono-methylation of lysine 4
of the H3 histone protein, and it is associated with enhancers and with DNA regions downstream of transcription
starts.  Additional histone marks and other chromatin associated ChIP-seq data is available at
the <A HREF=../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeBroadHistone>Broad Histone</A> page.

<H2>Display conventions</H2>
<p>By default this track uses a transparent overlay method of displaying data from a number of cell 
lines in the same vertical space.  Each of the cell lines in this track is associated with a particular
color, and these cell line colors are consistent across all tracks that
are part of the <A HREF=../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeReg>ENCODE Regulation</a> supertrack.
These colors are relatively light and saturated so as to work best with the transparent overlay.  
Unfortunately, outside the ENCODE Regulation tracks, older cell line
color conventions are used that don't match the cell line colors used in
the ENCODE Regulation tracks. The older colors were not used in the
ENCODE Regulation tracks because they were too dark for the transparent
overlay.

<P>Data users may freely use ENCODE data, but may not, without prior
consent, submit publications that use an unpublished ENCODE dataset until
nine months following the release of the dataset.  This date is listed in
the <EM>Restricted Until</EM> column, above.  The full data release policy
for ENCODE is available
