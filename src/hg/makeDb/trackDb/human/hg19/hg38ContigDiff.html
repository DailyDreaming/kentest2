<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the differences between the GRCh37 (hg19) and  GRCh38 (hg38) human genome 
assemblies, indicating hg19 contigs (or portions of contigs) that were not carried forward to the 
newer assembly.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The contig coordinates were extracted from the AGP files for both assemblies.
Contigs that matched the same name, same version, and the same specific
portion of sequence in both assemblies were considered identical between the two
assemblies and were excluded from this data set. The remaining contigs are shown
in this track.
