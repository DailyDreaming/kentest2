<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The Old UCSC Genes track shows genes from the previous version of
the UCSC Genes build.  This is similar to the current version but
without explicitly including Rfam or tRNA sequences.
</P>
<P>
The new release has 80,922 total transcripts, compared with 77,614 in
the previous version. The total number of canonical genes has
increased from 27,297 to 31,227. Comparing the new gene set with the
previous version:
<UL>
<LI>24,804 transcripts did not change between versions.</LI>
<LI>483 transcripts were not carried forward to the new version.</LI>
<LI>46,367 transcripts are &quot;compatible&quot; with those in the previous set,
meaning that the two transcripts show consistent splicing.  In most cases, 
the old and new transcripts differ in the lengths of their UTRs.</LI>
<LI>5,960 transcripts overlap with those in the previous set but do
not show consistent splicing, i.e., they contain overlapping introns
with differing splice sites.
