<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
ChIP analysis was performed using an antibody to E2F1 and HeLa cell chromatin.
E2F1 is a transcription factor important in controlling cell division.
Three independently crosslinked preparations of HeLa cells
were used to provide three independent biological replicates.  ChIP
assays were performed (with minor modifications which can be provided
upon request) using the protocol found at
<A HREF="https://genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/" TARGET=_blank>The Farnham 
Laboratory</A>.  Array hybridizations were performed using standard
NimbleGen Systems Inc. conditions.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Ratio intensity values (E2F1 vs. total) for each of three biological 
replicates were calculated and converted to log<sub>2</sub>.  Each set 
of ratio values was then independently scaled by its Tukey bi-weight mean.  
The three replicates were then combined by taking the median scaled 
log<sub>2</sub> ratio for each oligo.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Primers were chosen to correspond to 13 individual peaks.  
PCR reactions were performed for each of the 13 primer sets using 
amplicons derived from each of three biological samples (39 reactions).  
The PCR reactions confirmed that all of the 13 chosen peaks were bound 
by E2F1 in all three biological samples. </P>
