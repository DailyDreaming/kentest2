<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track contains all perfect 'microsatellite' repeats with between
2 and 10 bp repeat units and 10 or more perfect copies. Over 90% of
the items will be multi-allelic polymorphisms. Click on an individual
repeat element within the track for more information about that item.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
This track was created by using three programs: Tandyman, display_VNTR and 
Primeleftright.

    <LI> <A HREF="http://hemisphere.lanl.gov/tandyman/" TARGET=_BLANK>
    Tandyman</A> is a program for identifying perfectly identical tandem 
    repeat sequences written by Robert Leach.  It has been shown 
    that the number of continous perfect repeats in a microsatellite is 
    perhaps the primary factor in generating polymorphism at that locus.
    </LI>
    <LI>display_VNTR is a wrapper for tandyman which, among other things, 
    creates a fasta delimited file suitable for automated primer design.

    <LI> Primeleftright is a simple program which uses a strict set of 
    thermodynamic parameters to select primers giving the smallest possible 
    PCR product.

These programs were used (via linking Perl scripts to reformat output and 
input files) to find all perfect 'microsatellite' repeats with between 2 
and 10 bp repeat units and 10 or more perfect copies.

<P>
Particular features include:

<P> The high probability (&gt;90%) that elements of this track are polymorphic 
     and may have multiple alleles.
     </P>

<P> The exclusion of mono-nucleotide repeats. These are particularly
     common but very difficult to genotype.
     </P>

<P> The presence of a "distance to next repeat" score in bp allowing users to 
     filter overlapping repeats.
     </P>
<P> The primer designs are a first pass design which will improve in future 
     versions of this data. The main problem with the design is the tendency 
     of primers to end up in repeat regions near the repeat of interest. 
     Users may want to carry out their own QC on the quality of the designs 
     and we expect a good proportion of the design to be usable.
