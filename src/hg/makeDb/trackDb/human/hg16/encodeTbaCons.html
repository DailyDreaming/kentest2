<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays different measurements of conservation based on 
the Threaded Blockset Aligner (TBA) multiple sequence alignments of 
ENCODE regions shown in the TBA Alignment track. Three programs &mdash; binCons
(binomial-based conservation method), phastCons (phylogenetic hidden-Markov
model method), and 
<A HREF="http://mendel.stanford.edu/sidowlab/downloads/GERP/index.html"
TARGET=_blank>GERP</A> (Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling)
&mdash; generated the conservation scoring used to create this track. A related 
track, TBA Elements, shows multi-species conserved sequences (MCSs) based on
the conservation measurements displayed in this track.</P>
<P>
For details on the conservation scores generated by each program, refer to the 
individual Methods subsections.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The subtracks within this composite annotation track, which
show data from the binCons, phastCons and GERP programs, may be configured in a 
variety of ways to highlight different aspects of the 
displayed data. The graphical configuration options 
are shown at the top of the track description page, followed by a list of 
the subtracks.  A subtrack may be hidden from view by checking the box to the
left of the track name in the list.  For more information about the 
graphical configuration options, click the 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgWiggleTrackHelp.html" TARGET=_blank>Graph
configuration help</A> link.</P>
<P>
Color differences among the subtracks are arbitrary; they provide a
visual cue for distinguishing the different gene prediction methods. See the
Methods section for display information specific to each subtrack.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The methods used to create the TBA alignments in the ENCODE
regions are described in the TBA Alignment track description.</P>

<H3>BinCons</H3>
<P>
The binCons score is based on the cumulative binomial probability of 
detecting the observed number of identical bases (or greater) in 
sliding 25 bp windows (moving one bp at a time) between the 
reference sequence and each other species, given the neutral rate
at four-fold degenerate sites. Neutral rates are calculated
separately at each targeted region. For targets with no gene annotations,
the average percent identity across all alignable sequence was instead used
to weight the individual species binomial scores (this latter
weighting scheme was found to closely match 4D weights).</P>
<P>
The negative log of these P-values was then averaged across all 
human-referenced pairwise combinations, and the highest scoring overlapping 
25 bp window for each base was the resulting score. This track shows the 
plotting of a ranked percentile score normalized between 0 and 1 across all 
ENCODE regions, such that the top 5% most conserved sequence across all ENCODE
regions have a score of 0.95 or greater (top 10% have a score of 0.9 or 
greater, and so on).</P>
<P>
BinCons scores were normalized to represent a percentile to the power of
10. For example, scores representing the top 1 percent most conserved
sequence, 99th percentile, have a score greater than or equal to 0.99^10
= 0.904. Transforming scores to the power of 10 was done for visual
purposes only, in order to accentuate and distinguish the peaks of more
highly conserved regions.</P>
<P>
More details on binCons can be found in Margulies <em>et. al</em>. (2003)
cited below.</P>

<H3>PhastCons</H3>
<P>
The phastCons program predicts conserved elements and produces base-by-base
conservation scores using a two-state phylogenetic hidden Markov model.
The model consists of a state for conserved regions and a 
state for nonconserved regions, each of which is associated with a 
phylogenetic model.  These two models are identical
except that the branch lengths of the conserved phylogeny are 
multiplied by a scaling parameter <em>rho</em> (0 &lt; <em>rho</em> &lt; 1).</P>
<P>
For determining the conservation for the ENCODE TBA
alignments,  the nonconserved model was estimated 
from four-fold degenerate coding sites within the ENCODE regions using 
the program phyloFit. The parameter <em>rho</em> was then estimated by 
maximum likelihood, conditional on the nonconserved model, using the EM 
algorithm implemented in phastCons.  Parameter estimation was based on 
a single large alignment, constructed by concatenating the 
alignments for all conserved regions.</P>
<P>
PhastCons was run with the options <TT>--expected-lengths 15</TT> and
<TT>--target-coverage 0.05</TT> to obtain the desired level of 
&quot;smoothing&quot; and a final coverage by conserved elements of 5%.</P>
<P>
The conservation score at each base is the posterior probability that the
base was generated by the conserved state of the phylo-HMM.  It can
be interpreted as the probability that the base is in a conserved
element, given the assumptions of the model and the estimated parameters.
Scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores corresponding to
higher levels of conservation.  </P>
<P>
More details on phastCons can be found in Siepel <em>et. al.</em> (2005)
cited below.</P>

<H3>GERP</H3>
<P>
The GERP score is the expected substitution rate divided by
the observed substitution rate at a particular human base.
Scores are estimated on a column-by-column basis using multiple sequence
alignments of mammalian genomic DNA generated by MLAGAN.
The scores range from 0 to 3; those greater than 3 are clipped to 3. 
The expected and observed rates are
both calculated on a phylogenic tree using the same fixed topology.
The branch lengths of the expected tree are based on the average
substitutions at neutral sites.  The branch lengths of the observed
tree, which is calculated separately for each human base, are based on the
substitutions seen at the column of the
multiple alignment at that base.  Species that have gaps at
a particular column are not considered in the scoring for that column.</P>
<P>
Higher scores correspond to human
bases in alignment columns with higher degrees of similarity, <em>i.e.</em>
bases that have evolved slowly, some of which have been under purifying 
selection. The opposite holds true for swiftly evolving (low similarity) 
columns. </P>
<P>
Scores are deterministic, given a maximum-likelihood model of
nucleotide substitution, species topology, neutral tree, and alignment.</P>
