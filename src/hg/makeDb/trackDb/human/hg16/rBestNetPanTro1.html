<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the &quot;reciprocal best&quot; human/chimpanzee alignment 
net.  It is useful for finding orthologous regions and for studying genome
rearrangement.  
<P>
In the graphical display, the boxes represent ungapped 
alignments, while the lines represent gaps.  
In full display mode, the top-level (Level 1)
chains are the largest, highest-scoring chains that
span this region.  In many cases, gaps exist in the
top-level chains.  When possible, these are filled in by
other chains displayed at Level 2.  The gaps in 
Level 2 chains may be filled by Level 3 chains and so
forth.
Clicking on a box displays detailed information about the chain
as a whole, while clicking on a line shows information
on the gap.  The detailed information is useful in determining
the cause of the gap or, for lower-level chains, the genomic
rearrangement. 
<P>
Individual track features are categorized as one of four types
(other than gap):
<UL>
<LI><B>Top</B> - the best, longest match. Displayed on Level 1.
<LI><B>Syn</B> - aligns to the same chromosome as the gap in the level
    above it.
<LI><B>Inv</B> - aligns to the same chromosome as the gap above it, but in the
    opposite orientation.
<LI><B>NonSyn</B> - matches a different chromosome from the gap in the level 
above it.
</UL></P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
These alignments were generated using blastz and blat alignments of chimpanzee
genomic sequence from the 13 Nov. 2003 Arachne chimpanzee draft assembly.
The initial alignments were generated using blastz on 
repeatmasked sequence using the following chimp/human scoring matrix:
<PRE>
     A    C    G    T
A   100 -300 -150 -300
C  -300  100 -300 -150
G  -150 -300  100 -300
T  -300 -150 -300  100

K = 4500, L = 3000,  Y=3400, H=2000
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The resulting alignments were processed by the axtChain program.
AxtChain organizes all the alignments between a single chimp chromosome
and a single $organism chromosome into a group and makes a kd-tree out
of all the gapless subsections (blocks) of the alignments.
The maximally-scoring chains of these blocks were found by running a
dynamic program over the kd-tree.  Chains scoring below a certain
threshold were discarded.
<P>
To place additional chimp scaffolds that weren't initially aligned by blastz,
a DNA blat of the unmasked sequence was performed. The resulting
blat alignments were also chained, and then merged with the
blastz-based chains produced in the previous step to produce "all chains".
<P>
These chains were sorted with the 
highest-scoring chains in the genome ranked first. The program
chainNet was then used to place the chains one at a time, trimming them as 
necessary to fit into sections not already covered by a higher-scoring chain. 
During this process, a natural hierarchy emerged in which a chain that filled 
a gap in a higher-scoring chain was placed underneath that chain. The program 
netSyntenic was used to fill in information about the relationship between 
higher- and lower-level chains, such as whether a lower-level
chain was syntenic or inverted relative to the higher-level chain. </P>
<P>
Due to the draft nature of this initial genome assembly,
this net track (and the companion chain track) was generated using
a &quot;reciprocal best&quot; strategy.  This strategy attempts to minimize
paralog fill-in for missing orthologous chimp sequence by filtering
from the human net all sequences not found in the chimp side of the
net.  After generating the human alignment net, 
the subset of chains in the chimp-reference net was extracted
and used for an additional netting step, which was then filtered
for non-syntenic sequences smaller than 50 bases.</P>
