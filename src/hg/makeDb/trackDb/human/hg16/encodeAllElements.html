<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
These tracks represent conserved elements detected by any (union) or all
(intersection) combinations of elements produced by binCons, phastCons, and 
GERP conservation scoring methods applied to TBA and MLAGAN sequence alignments 
of 23 vertebrates in the ENCODE regions.  
<P>
For more information on the individual subtracks, see the
description pages for the TBA Elements and MLAGAN Elements tracks.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The locations of conserved elements are indicated by blocks in the graphical 
display.  The display may be filtered to show only those items 
with unnormalized scores that meet or exceed a certain threshhold. To set a 
threshhold, type the minimum score into the text box at the top of the 
description page. To show only selected subtracks within this annotation, 
uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
In these annotations, &quot;non-coding&quot; refers to those regions
not overlapping with CDS regions in any of the following UCSC Genome Browser
tables: refFlat, knownGene, mgcGenes, vegaGene, or ensGene.
<P>
See the description pages for the TBA Elements and MLAGAN Elements 
for additional information about methods used to generate these data.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
See the description pages for the TBA Elements and MLAGAN Elements 
for information about verification techniques used to generate these data.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
BinCons and phastCons MCS data were contributed by Elliott Margulies in the 
<A HREF="https://www.genome.gov/27535200/" TARGET=_blank>Eric Green lab</A> at 
NHGRI, with assistance from Adam Siepel of UCSC.</P>
<P>
GERP was developed primarily by Greg Cooper in the lab of 
<A HREF="http://mendel.stanford.edu/sidowlab/" TARGET=_blank>Arend Sidow</A> 
at Stanford University (Depts of Pathology and Genetics), in close collaboration
with Eric Stone (Biostatistics, NC State), and George Asimenos and 
Eugene Davydov in the lab of
