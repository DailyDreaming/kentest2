<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The Known Genes II track was built based on UCSC Known Genes data set of hg17
(Human May 2004 Assembly). Clicking the "Outside Link" entry above will bring
you to the gene details page of <B><font color=red>hg17 (Human May 2004 Assembly)</font></B>.
The original "Known Genes" track of hg16 (built in March, 2004) is somewhat outdated,
but still available.
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The hg17 UCSC Known Genes was built by a new process, KG II, 
as described below.
<P>
UniProt protein sequences (including alternative splicing isoforms) 
and mRNA sequences from RefSeq and GenBank 
were aligned against the base genome using BLAT. 
RefSeq alignments having a base identity level within 0.1% of the best 
and at least 96% base identity with the genomic sequence were kept.  
GenBank mRNA alignments having a base identity level within 0.2% of 
the best and at least 97% base identity with the genomic sequence were kept.  
Protein alignments having a base identity level within 0.2% of the best and 
at least 80% base identity with the genomic sequence were kept.
<P>Then the genomic mRNA and protein alignments were compared, 
and protein-mRNA pairings were determined from their overlaps. 
mRNA CDS data were obtained from RefSeq and GenBank data 
and supplemented by CDS structures derived from UCSC protein-mRNA BLAT alignments. 
The initial set of UCSC Known Genes candidates consists of 
all protein-mRNA pairs with valid mRNA CDS structures.  
A gene-check program (similar to the one used for the Consensus CDS (CCDS) project) 
is used to remove questionable candidates, such as those with in-frame stop 
codons, missing start or stop codons, etc.
<P>From each group of gene candidates that share the same CDS structure, 
the protein-mRNA pair having the best ranking and protein-mRNA alignment score 
is selected as a UCSC Known Gene.  
The ranking of a gene candidate depends on its gene-check quality measures.  
When all else is equal, 
a preference is given to RefSeq mRNAs and next to MGC mRNAs.  
Similarly, preference is given to gene candidates represented by Swiss-Prot 
proteins.  
The protein-mRNA alignment score is calculated based on a protein-to-mRNA 
alignment using TBLASTN, plus weighted sub-scores according 
to the date and length of the mRNA.
