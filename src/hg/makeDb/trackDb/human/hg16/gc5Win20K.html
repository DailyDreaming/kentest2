<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The GC percent track shows the percentage of G (guanine) and C (cytosine) bases
in a 5-base windows.  High GC content is typically associated with
gene-rich areas.
</P>
<P>
This track was produced by measuring GC percent in 5 bases, then running
a 20,000 base smoothing window over that data to indicate the average
GC percent in the 20,000 base window, at each 5 base interval.
Thus, each 5 base point in the graph represents the average GC percent
in the next 20,000 bases.
