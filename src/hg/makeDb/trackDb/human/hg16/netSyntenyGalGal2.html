<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows the $o_organism/$organism chains for syntenic 
regions of $o_organism ($o_date - $o_db) and $organism.  </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The $o_Organism/$Organism Alignment Net track (netGalGal2) was processed 
with netFilter -syn to produce this set of syntenic alignments.  </P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>The chainNet, netSyntenic, netFilter and netClass programs were
developed at the University of California
at Santa Cruz by Jim Kent.
