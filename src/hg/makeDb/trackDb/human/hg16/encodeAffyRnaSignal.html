<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows an estimate of RNA abundance (transcription) for
all ENCODE regions.  Retinoic acid-stimulated HL-60 cells were
harvested after 0, 2, 8, and 32 hours.  
Purified cytosolic polyA+ RNA from unstimulated GM06990 and HeLa cells, 
as well as purified polyA+ RNA from the RA-stimulated HL-60 samples, 
was hybridized to Affymetrix ENCODE oligonucleotide
tiling arrays, which have 25-mer probes tiled every 22 bp on
average in the non-repetitive ENCODE regions. 
Composite signals are shown in
separate subtracks for each cell type and for each of the four 
timepoints for RA-stimulated HL-60.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The subtracks within this composite annotation track
may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects of the 
displayed data. The graphical configuration options for the subtracks 
are shown at the top of the track description page, followed by a list of 
subtracks. To show only selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to 
the tracks that you wish to hide.  
For more information about the graphical configuration options, click the 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgWiggleTrackHelp.html" TARGET=_blank>Graph
configuration help</A> link.</P>
<P>
Color differences among the subtracks are arbitrary. They provide a
visual cue for distinguishing between the different cell types and 
timepoints.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The data from replicate arrays were quantile-normalized (Bolstad
<em>et al</em>., 2003) and all arrays were scaled to a median array intensity
of 22.  Within a sliding 101 bp window centered on each probe, 
an estimate of RNA abundance (signal) was found by calculating the median 
of all pairwise average PM-MM values, where PM is a perfect match and MM is 
a mismatch. Both Kapranov <em>et al</em>. (2002) and Cawley 
<em>et al</em>. (2004) are good references for the experimental methods; 
Cawley <em>et al</em>. also describes the analytical methods.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Three independent biological replicates were generated and hybridized
to duplicate arrays (two technical replicates). Transcribed regions
were generated from the composite signal track by merging genomic positions
to which probes are mapped. This merging was based on a 5% false
positive rate cutoff in negative bacterial controls, a maximum
gap (MaxGap) of 50 base-pairs and minimum run (MinRun) of 50 base-pairs (see
the Affy TransFrags track for the merged regions).
