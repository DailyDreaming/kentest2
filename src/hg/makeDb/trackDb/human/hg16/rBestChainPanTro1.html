<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows &quot;reciprocal best&quot; alignments of $o_organism 
($o_db, $o_date) to the $organism genome. These alignments were generated 
using blastz and blat alignments of $o_organism genomic sequence from the 
Nov. 2003 Arachne draft assembly.  Alignments were made using a gap scoring 
system that allows longer gaps than traditional affine gap scoring systems. 
It can also tolerate gaps in both $o_organism and $organism simultaneously. 
These &quot;double-sided&quot; gaps can be caused by local inversions and
overlapping deletions in both species.  
<P>
The chain track displays boxes joined together by either single or
double lines. The boxes represent aligning regions.
Single lines indicate gaps that are largely due to a deletion in the
$o_organism assembly or an insertion in the $organism
assembly.  Double lines represent more complex gaps that involve substantial
sequence in both species. This may result from inversions, overlapping
deletions, an abundance of local mutation, or an unsequenced gap in one
species.  In cases where multiple chains align over a particular region of
the $organism genome, the chains with single-lined gaps are often
due to processed pseudogenes, while chains with double-lined gaps are more
often due to paralogs and unprocessed pseudogenes.</P>
<P>
In the "pack" and "full" display
modes, the individual feature names indicate the chromosome, strand, and
location (in thousands) of the match for each matching alignment.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The alignments were generated by blastz on repeatmasked sequence using
the following $organism/$o_organism scoring matrix:
<PRE>
          A    C    G    T     A   100 -300 -150 -300
     C  -300  100 -300 -150     G  -150 -300  100 -300
     T  -300 -150 -300  100

     K = 4500, L = 3000,  Y = 3400, H = 2000
</PRE></P>
<P>
The resulting alignments were fed into axtChain, which organizes all
alignments between a single $o_organism chromosome and a single
$organism chromosome into a group and creates a kd-tree out
of the gapless subsections (blocks) of the alignments. A dynamic program
was then run over the kd-trees to find the maximally scoring chains of these
blocks. Chains scoring below a threshold were discarded.</P>
<P>
To place additional chimp sequences not initially aligned by blastz,
a DNA blat of the unmasked sequence was performed. The resulting
blat alignments were also chained and then merged with the blastz-based 
chains from the previous step to produce a set of &quot;all chains&quot;. </P>
<P>
Due to the draft nature of this initial genome assembly,
the chain track and the companion net track were generated using
a &quot;reciprocal best&quot; strategy.  This strategy attempts to minimize
paralog fill-in for missing orthologous chimp sequence by filtering
out of the human net all sequences not on the chimp side of the net.</P>
<P>
First, the merged blastz and blat chains were used to generate an alignment 
net using the program chainNet (described on the Chimp Recip Net track 
description page). Next, the subset of chains in the chimp-reference net were 
extracted and used for an additional netting step. The resulting 
human-reference net was used to generate the reciprocal best Chimp Recip Net 
browser track.  Non-syntenic sequences smaller than 50 bases were filtered 
out.  Chains extracted from this net are displayed on the Chimp Recip Chain
browser track. </P>

The $o_organism sequence used in this track was obtained from the 13 Nov.
2003 Arachne assembly. We'd like to thank the National Human Genome Research
Institute (NHGRI), the Broad Institute at MIT/Harvard, and Washington
University St. Louis School of Medicine for providing this sequence.</P>
