<head><title>Recent Human non-CpG Substitutions and Indels</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFF9D2"><b>hg16-mm3-rn3-pt0</b><br>
Collected and merged blocks of 100 bp 96% id between mm-rn-pt.<br><br>
Compared human to blocks.<br>
Computed probability of rejecting the null hypothesis of equal substitution rate in whole tree<br>
 * using a phyloHMM fit on phastCons conserverd regions<br>
 * alternative hypothesis: human branch has faster rate<br>
 * deleted all columns with gap characters from probability computation, maintaining only columns with a base in all four species.<br><br>
Only blocks with probability > 0 of rejecting the null hypotheses are included.
