<H2>Description</H2> <P>
This track plots the level of evolutionary conservation along the genome,
    as estimated from multiple alignments of the human (hg16), mouse
    (mm3), and rat (rn3) genomes.  The conservation score shown here is
    based on a phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM).</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>

    <P>A phylo-HMM is a probabilistic model that describes both the process
    of DNA substitution at each site in a genome, and the way this process
    changes from one site to the next (Felsenstein and Churchill 1996,
    Yang 1995, Siepel and Haussler 2003, Siepel and Haussler 2004).  
    A phylo-HMM can be thought
    of as a machine that generates a multiple alignment, in the same way
    that an ordinary hidden Markov model (HMM) generates an individual
    sequence.  While the states of an ordinary HMM are associated with
    simple multinomial probability distributions, however, the states of a
    phylo-HMM are associated with more complex distributions defined by
    probabilistic phylogenetic models.  These distributions can capture
    differences in the rates and patterns of nucleotide 
    substitution observed in different types of genomic regions (e.g., coding
    or noncoding regions, conserved or nonconserved regions).

    <P> <img src="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~acs/fels-church.jpg" border="1"
    align="right"> To compute a conservation score, we use a
    <em>k</em>-state phylo-HMM, whose <em>k</em> associated phylogenetic
    models differ only in overall evolutionary rate (Felsenstein and
    Churchill 1996, Yang 1995).  (In the picture at right, <em>k</em> = 3,
    but in practice, we use <em>k</em> = 10.)  A phylogenetic model is
    estimated globally, using the discrete gamma model for rate variation
    (Yang 1994), then a scaled version of the estimated model is associated
    with each state in a phylo-HMM (see picture).  (There is a separate
    "rate constant," <em>r_i</em>, for each state <em>i</em>, which is
    multiplied by all branch lengths in the globally estimated model.)  The
    transition probabilities between states allow for autocorrelation of
    substitution rates, i.e., for adjacent sites to tend to exhibit similar
    overall substitution rates.  A single parameter lambda describes the
    degree of autocorrelation and defines all transition probabilities (see
    picture).  Here, we have estimated the rate constants from the data,
    similarly to Yang (1995) (see Siepel and Haussler 2003), but have
    allowed lambda to be treated as a tuning parameter.  For the
    conservation score, we use the posterior probability that each site was
    "generated" by the state having the smallest rate constant.  Because of
    the way the rate categories are defined, the plotted values can be
    thought of as approximately representing the posterior probability that
    each site is among the 10% most conserved sites in the data set
    (allowing for autocorrelation of substitution rates).  </P>

    <P> In this case, the general reversible (REV) substitution model was
    used in parameter estimation, and lambda was set to 0.9.  Alignment
    gaps were treated as missing data, which sometimes has the effect of
    producing undesirably high posterior probabilities in gappy regions of
    the alignment.  We are looking at several possible ways of improving
    the handling of alignment gaps.</P>
