<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays the p-values (-log<sub>10</sub>) of the Bipolar disease pooled data reported by 
NIMH in their Molecular Psychiatry paper.  
They performed a Genome Wide Association study on two populations:
<UL>
<LI>US - European Descent, 461 cases in 7 pools, 563 controls in 9 pools</LI>
<LI>DE - German, 772 cases in 13 pools, 876 controls in 10 pools</LI>
</UL></P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Reported p-values are taken for each of the Illumina550 probes on the genome, 
then logged and minused for visualization purposes.  These p-values have not
been Bonferroni adjusted. US cases had an affected sibling.  96% of German
sample reported both parents and grandparents were born in Germany.
The German sample was used to replicate the US sample.  The following
conditions were applied to the US sample: pval &lt; 0.05, Odds Ratio &gt; 1.4 or &lt; 0.71,
Relative Allele Frequency &gt; 0.05, required to be near a known gene,
and finally replicated in the German sample with pval &lt; 0.05.  The results
left 88 SNPs in 80 genes.  
<p>
When individually genotyped, 76% remained significant in US,
and 36% of those remained significant in the German sample.  Combined p-values
were also calculated for the SNPs yielding the most significant find
rs1012053 pvalue = 1.5e-8 for the gene DGKH diacylglyceral kinase,
which is still significant after Bonferroni adjustment. DGKH
protein is key in the lithium-sensitive phosphatidyl inositol pathway.
Several other risk SNPs were identified of small effect.
