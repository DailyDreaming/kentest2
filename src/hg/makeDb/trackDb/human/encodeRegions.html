<P>
This track depicts target regions for the 
<A HREF="https://www.genome.gov/10005107" TARGET=_BLANK>NHGRI ENCODE 
project</A>.
The long-term goal of this project is to identify all functional elements 
in the human genome sequence to facilitate a better understanding of human 
biology and disease. </P>
<P>
During the pilot phase, 44 regions comprising 30 Mb &mdash; approximately 
1% of the human genome &mdash; have been selected for intensive study to identify, 
locate and analyze functional elements within the regions. These targets are 
being studied by a diverse public research consortium to test and evaluate the
efficacy of various methods, technologies, and strategies for locating 
genomic features. The outcome of this initial phase will form the basis for a 
larger-scale effort to analyze the entire human genome.</P>
<P>
See the NHGRI <A HREF="https://www.genome.gov/10506161" TARGET=_BLANK>target 
selection process</A> web page for a description of how the target 
regions were selected. </P>

To open a UCSC Genome Browser with a menu for selecting ENCODE regions on the 
human genome, use <A HREF="../ENCODE/encode.hg17.html"

provided for the ENCODE project are described on the 
<A HREF="../encode">UCSC ENCODE Portal</A>.</P>
