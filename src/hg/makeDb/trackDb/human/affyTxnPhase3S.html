<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays transcriptome data from tiling GeneChips produced by 
<A HREF="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/microarray-analysis.html" target="_blank">Affymetrix</A>. For the 
complete non-repetitive portion of the human genome, more than 256 million probepairs were tiled every 5 bp in non-repeat-masked areas and hybridized to 
whole-cell short RNA (&lt;200 nucleotides) from two different cell lines. 
Note that the female cell lines HeLa, SK-N-AS, and U87MG do not contain data 
for chrY. Data were collected using a strand-specific methodology that allows 
separate measurements for top strand (sense) and bottom strand (antisense) RNA 
signals. For experimental details and results, see Kapranov <em>et al</em>. in 
the References section below. </P>
<P>
This track contains the signal level estimated for each mapped probe position 
after hybridization with short RNA samples.
A separate track named &quot;Affy Tx sRNA Reg&quot; contains transcribed
fragments (transfrags) representing short RNAs (see Kapranov <em>et al</em>. in
the References section below). While the raw data are based on perfect match
minus mismatch (PM - MM) probe values and may contain negative values, the
track has a minimum value of zero for visualization purposes. Likewise, the
probes with high signal values will be cut off at the intensity of 150 by 
default and will appear to have similar magnitude.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This annotation follows the display conventions for composite tracks. The
subtracks within this annotation may be configured in a variety of ways to
highlight different aspects of the displayed data. The graphical configuration
options are shown at the top of the track description page, followed by a list
of subtracks. For more information about the graphical configuration options,
click the <A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgWiggleTrackHelp.html">Graph
configuration help</A> link. To display only selected subtracks, uncheck the
boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Genomic regions corresponding to the sRNA transcripts were mapped for the plus
or the minus strands of the genome and for HepG2 and HeLa cell lines
respectively. The following analysis steps were performed: 
<OL>
<LI>
Replicate arrays were quantile-normalized and the median intensity (using both 
PM and MM intensities) of each array was scaled to a target value of 20. 
<LI>
The expression level was estimated for each mapped probe position without
application of a smoothing window. This was followed by the generation of
transfrags in the track labeled &quot;Affy Tx sRNA Reg&quot; as follows: 
<UL>
<LI>
probes with intensities corresponding to the 98th percentile of
all the PM-MM probe intensities were identified.
<LI>
transfrags were determined by connecting adjacent positive probes with a maximum
allowable gap of four nucleotides and a minimum run of seven nucleotides (at 
least two consecutive positive probes with no negative probes between), and must
be called positive reproducibly in both biological replicas.
<LI>
to further prioritize the transfrag maps, the intensities of all the
transfrags were calculated based on the composite signals of the two biological
replicas, and transfrags corresponding to the top 25 quartile were used
for further analysis.
</UL>
<LI>
In addition, several successive steps were performed to avoid potentially 
cross-hybridizing sequences and/or those that mapped to potentially non-unique 
regions. Transfrags were discarded that overlapped pseudogenes or harbored 
low-complexity or repetitive sequences. These maps are believed to represent a 
very conservative view of the sRNA population in the cell.
