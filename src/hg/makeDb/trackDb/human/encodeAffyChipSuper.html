<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
This super-track combines related tracks of ChIP-chip data
generated by the Affymetrix/Harvard ENCODE collaboration.
ChIP-chip, also known as genome-wide location analysis, is a technique for
isolation and identification of DNA sequences bound by specific proteins in
cells.
</P>
<P>
These tracks contain ChIP-chip data of multiple transcription
factors, RNA polymerase II and histones, in multiple cell lines,
including HL-60 (leukemia) and ME-180 (cervical carcinoma),
and at different time points after drug cell treatment.
Binding was assayed on Affymetrix ENCODE tiling arrays.
Data are displayed as signals, 
median p-values, &quot;strict&quot; p-values and sites.
