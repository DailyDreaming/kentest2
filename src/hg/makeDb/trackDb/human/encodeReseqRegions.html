<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track depicts the 10 ENCODE resequencing regions for the 
<A HREF="https://www.genome.gov/10005107/" TARGET=_BLANK>NHGRI ENCODE 
project</A>.
The long-term goal of this project is to identify all functional elements 
in the human genome sequence to facilitate a better understanding of human 
biology and disease. </P>
<P>
These regions were chosen out of the 44 total.  The resequencing was done 
by Broad and Baylor.

<P>
See the NHGRI <A HREF="https://www.genome.gov/10506161/" TARGET=_BLANK>target 
selection process</A> web page for a description of how the target 
regions were selected. </P>
<P>
To open a UCSC Genome Browser with a menu for selecting ENCODE regions on the 
Build 34 human genome, use <A HREF="../encode/encode.hg16.html" 
TARGET=_BLANK>ENCODE Regions in the UCSC Browser</A>. The UCSC resources 
provided for the ENCODE project are described on the 
<A HREF="../encode">UCSC ENCODE Portal</A>.</P>
