<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays the trend p-values (-log<sub>10</sub>) of the seven 
diseases reported by The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (see 
References section below).  The diseases studied are:
<UL>
<LI>Bipolar disorder</LI>
<LI>Coronary artery disease</LI>
<LI>Crohn's disease</LI>
<LI>Hypertension</LI>
<LI>Rheumatoid arthritis</LI>
<LI>Type 1 diabetes</LI>
<LI>Type 2 diabetes</LI>
</UL></P>

<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>
Reported p-values were taken for each of the Illumina550 probes on the genome.
For visualization purposes, these p-values were logged and negated.</P>
<P>
Most of the data for chromosome X is omitted from this track 
because of the difference in statistical power and the difference in 
control sets used.  
The trend p-value captures the majority of the associated signals, therefore
it was used to create this track instead of the genotypic p-value.
