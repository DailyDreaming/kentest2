<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.snpedia.com" target=_blank >SNPedia</a> is a wiki investigating human
genetics with information about the effects of variations in DNA, citing
peer-reviewed scientific publications.

<h4>SNPedia all: SNPedia all SNPs (including empty pages)</h4>
<p>
The track &#34;SNPedia all&#34; shows all SNPs that exist as a page in 
<a href="https://www.snpedia.com"target=_blank >SNPedia.com</a>. As SNPedia's user collaboration grows, more 
detail will be added to SNPedia.com pages. For now, most of the pages are auto-generated by bots 
and have empty pages. According to Mike Carioso (SNPedia.com founder), SNPedia entries are mostly 
ClinVar entries marked as pathogenic with at least 4 stars as defined by the
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/details/#review_status" target=_blank>
ClinVar review status</a>. 
</p>

<h4>SNPedia with text: SNPedia pages with manually typed text</h4>
<p>
The track &#34;SNPedia with text&#34; is a subset of the &#34;SNPedia all&#34; track. This track 
displays only SNPedia entries with a text page that was created manually by a user who typed in 
some text (approximately 5,000 entries). In the browser, click on the &#34;configure&#34; button
and select &#34;next/previous item navigation&#34; to show clickable arrows in the browser which
will jump to the next or previous item.
</p>
<p>
Clicks on the features show the text from the SNPedia.com page and a link to the original page.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
Genomic locations of SNPedia entries are labeled with the <a href=
"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/index.html" target=_blank> dbSNP</a> ID.
</p>

<p>
In the track &#34;SNPedia all SNPs&#34;, the features are colored based on the SNPedia microarray 
annotation: grey for SNPs that are on no microarray, dark blue for Affymetrix, dark purple for 
Illumina and black for features on both arrays.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
The mappings displayed in this track were used as provided in the SNPedia GFF file.
For the &#34;SNPedia with text&#34; track, all SNPedia pages were downloaded and their content 
checked with a script that tries to remove pages that were auto-generated and not created manually 
by a user.
</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>
Thanks to Mike Cariaso for help with the GFF download and Max Haeussler at UCSC for building this 
track.
