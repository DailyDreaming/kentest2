<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Each of these four tracks shows the map of signal intensity 
(estimating the fold enrichment [log2 scale] of ChIP DNA vs 
unstimulated DNA) for STAT1 ChIP-chip using Human Hela S3 cells 
hybridized to four different array designs/platforms. The first 
three platforms are custom maskless photolithographic arrays 
with oligonucleotides tiling most of the non-repetitive DNA 
sequence of the ENCODE regions: 
<UL>
<LI>Maskless design #1: 50-mer oligonucleotides tiled every 
38 bps (overlapping by 12 nts)
<LI>Maskless design #2: 36-mer oligonucleotides tiled end to end
<LI>Maskless design #3: 50-mer oligonucleotides tiled end to end
</UL></P>
<P>
The fourth array platform is an ENCODE PCR 
Amplicon array manufactured by Bing Ren's lab at UCSD. </P>
<P>
Each track shows the combined results of multiple biological replicates: five 
for the first maskless array (50-mer every 38 bp), two for the 
second maskless array (36-mer every 36 bp), three for the third 
maskless array (50-mer every 50 bp) and six for the PCR Amplicon 
array. For all arrays, the STAT1 ChIP DNA was labeled with Cy5 and 
the control DNA was labeled with Cy3.</P>
<P>
These data are available at NCBI GEO as 
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=
GSE2714"
TARGET=_blank>GSE2714</A>, which also provides additional information about
the experimental protocols.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This annotation follows the display conventions for composite 
&quot;wiggle&quot; tracks. The subtracks within this annotation 
may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects of the 
displayed data. The graphical configuration options are shown at the top of 
the track description page, followed by a list of subtracks.  To display only 
selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide.

<H2>Methods</H2>

<H3>Maskless photolithographic arrays</H3>
<P>
The data from replicates were median-scaled and quantile-normalized to each 
other (both Cy3 and Cy5 channels). Using a 
501 bp sliding window centered on each oligonucleotide probe, a 
signal map (estimating the fold enrichment [log<sub>2</sub> 
scale] of ChIP DNA) was generated by computing the pseudomedian 
signal of all log<sub>2</sub>(Cy5/Cy3) ratios (median of 
pairwise averages) within the window, including replicates. 
Using the same procedure, a -log<sub>10</sub>(P-value) map 
(measuring significance of enrichment of oligonucleotide probes 
in the window) for all sliding windows was made by computing 
P-values using the Wilcoxon paired signed rank test comparing 
fluorensent intensity between Cy5 and Cy3 for each 
oligonucleotide probe (Cy5 and Cy3 signals from the same array). 
A binding site was determined by thresholding both on fold 
enrichment and -log<sub>10</sub>(P-value) and requiring a 
maximum gap and a minimum run between oligonucleotide positions. </P>
<P>
For the first maskless array (50-mer every 38 bp):
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;log<sub>2</sub>(Cy5/Cy3) &gt;= 1.25, -log<sub>10</sub>(P-value) &gt;= 
8.0, MaxGap &lt;= 100 bp, MinRun &gt;= 180 bp</P>
<P>
For the second maskless array (36-mer every 36 bp): 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;log<sub>2</sub>(Cy5/Cy3) &gt;= 0.25, -log<sub>10</sub>(P-value) &gt;= 
4.0, MaxGap &lt;= 250 bp, MinRun &gt;= 0 bp</P>
<P>
For the third maskless array (50-mer every 50 bp): 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;log<sub>2</sub>(Cy5/Cy3) &gt;= 0.25, -log<sub>10</sub>(P-value) &gt;= 
4.0, MaxGap &lt;= 250 bp, MinRun &gt;= 0 bp</P>

<H3>PCR Amplicon Arrays</H3>
<P>
The Cy5 and Cy3 array data were loess-normalized between channels 
on the same slide and then between slides. A z-score was then 
determined for each PCR amplicon from the distribution of 
log(Cy5/Cy3) in a local log(Cy5*Cy3) intensity window (see 
Quackenbush, 2002 and the 
<A HREF="http://array.mbb.yale.edu/analysis/" TARGET=_blank>Express 
Yourself</A> website for more details). From the z-score, a P-value was then 
associated with each PCR amplicon. Hits were determined using a 3 sigma 
threshold and requiring a spot to be present on three out of six arrays.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
ChIP-chip binding sites were verified by comparing &quot;hit lists&quot; 
generated from combinations of different biological replicates. 
Only experiments that yielded a significant overlap (greater than 
50 percent) were accepted. As an independent check (for maskless 
arrays), data on the microarray were randomized with respect to 
position and re-scored; significantly fewer hits (consistent 
with random noise) were generated this way.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
These data were generated and analyzed by the labs of Michael 
Snyder, Mark Gerstein and Sherman Weissman at Yale University. The PCR 
Amplicon arrays were manufactured by Bing Ren's lab at UCSD.</P>
