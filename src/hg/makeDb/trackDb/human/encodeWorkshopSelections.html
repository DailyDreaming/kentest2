<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This annotation is a collection of selected non-coding Affy transcribed
fragments (transfrags) and Yale transcriptionally-active regions (TARs) from
the Affy Transfrags and Yale TAR annotation tracks, grouped into subsets based
on their proximity to the transcript-coding and exon-coding regions of
GenCode genes. Each subtrack shows the union of data from the eleven
related individual subtracks in the Unann Transfrags track. </P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Consensus Intronic Proximal: </B>
shows all transfrags/TARs within Gencode gene introns that are proximal to a
Gencode gene exon, <em>i.e.</em> are within a Gencode gene transcript-coding
region and are within 5000 bases of a Gencode gene exon-coding region.
<LI>
<B>Consensus Intronic Distal: </B>
shows all transfrags/TARs within Gencode gene introns that are not near an
exon, <em>i.e.</em> are within a Gencode gene transcript-coding region, but at
least 5000 base pairs away from any Gencode gene exon-coding region.
<LI>
<B>Consensus Intergenic Proximal: </B>
shows all transfrags/TARs in the ENCODE intergenic regions that are proximal to
a Gencode gene exon, <em>i.e.</em> are outside the Gencode gene
transcript-coding regions, but are within 5000 base pairs of a Gencode gene
exon-coding region.
<LI>
<B>Consensus Intergenic Distal: </B>
shows all transfrags/TARs in the ENCODE intergenic regions that are not near an
exon,
<em>i.e.</em> are outside the Gencode gene transcript-coding regions and at
least 5000 base pairs away from any of the Gencode gene exon-coding regions.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This annotation track is comprised of subtracks that show
different aspects of the displayed data. The complete list of subtracks
is displayed near the top of the track description page. To display only
selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
This annotation track was derived from data contained in the Yale TAR, Affy
Transfrags, and Gencode Genes annotation tracks using the UCSC Table Browser.
See the description pages associated with these annotation tracks for more
information about the data sets. </P>
