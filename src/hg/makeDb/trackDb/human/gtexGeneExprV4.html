<H2>Description</H2>
This track shows median gene expression levels in 52 tissues, based on RNA-seq data
from 2921 samples from 214 donors, generated and analyzed by the
<a target="_blank" href="">NIH Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEX) project</a>.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Gene-level expression files from GTEx analysis (2014-01-17) of RNA-Seq data and sample metadata
were downloaded from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gtexportal.org">GTEX portal</a>:
<a href="http://www.gtexportal.org/static/datasets/gtex_analysis_2014_01_17/rna_seq_data/GTEx_Analysis_2014-01-17_RNA-seq_RNA-SeQCv1.1.8_gene_rpkm.gct.gz">GTEx_Analysis_2014-01-17_RNA-seq_RNA-SeQCv1.1.8_gene_rpkm.gct</a>.</P>
<P>
Median expression level (RPKM) for each tissue was computed per gene, and coordinates
were assigned by identifying the UCSC known gene canonical transcript for each Ensembl
gene in the GTEX data file.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions</H2>
<P>
Each gene is represented by a colored bar graph, where bar color indicates tissue and
relative bar height the median expression level.  The tissue color legend is shown below.
The graph display is fixed width, height,
and tissue order for all genes. The graph is shown beginning at the transcription start site of the canonical transcript (currently the UCSC known genes canonical transcript) for the gene. </P>
<P>
The details pages shows per-sample expression levels, along with a more detailed bar graph (Tukey plot).</P>
