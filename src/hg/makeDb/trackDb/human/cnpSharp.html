<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows 160 regions detected as putative copy number 
polymorphisms by BAC microarray analysis in a population of 47 individuals, 
comprising 8 Chinese, 4 Japanese, 10 Czech, 2 Druze, 7 Biaka, 9 Mbuti, 
and 7 Amerindians. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Hybridizations were all performed in duplicate incorporating a dye-reversal 
using a custom array consisting of 2194 end-sequence or FISH confirmed BACs, 
targeted to regions of the genome flanked by segmental duplications. 
The false positive rate was estimated as ~3 clones per 4,000 tested.</P>
