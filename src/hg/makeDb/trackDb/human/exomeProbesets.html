<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
This set of tracks shows the genomic positions of <b>probes</b> and <b>targets</b> from a full 
suite of in-solution-capture target enrichment exome kits for <b>Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)</b>
applications. Also known as <b>exome sequencing</b> or <b>whole exome sequencing (WES)</b>, 
this technique allows high-throughput parallel sequencing of all exons (e.g., coding regions of genes 
which affect protein function), constituting about 1% of the human genome, or approximately 30 
million base pairs.
</p>
<p> 
The tracks are intended to show the major differences in target genomic regions between the 
different exome capture kits from the major players in the NGS sequencing market:

<p>
Tracks labeled as <em><b>Probes (P)</em></b> indicate the footprint of the oligonucleotide probes
mapped to the human genome. This is the technically relevant targeted region by the assay. However, 
the sequenced region will be bigger than this since flanking sequences are sequenced as well.  
Tracks labeled as <em><b>Target Regions (T)</em></b> indicate the genomic regions targeted by the
assay. This is the biologically relevant target region. Not all targeted regions
will necessarily be sequenced perfectly; there might be some capture bias at certain locations.
The Target
Regions are those normally used for coverage analysis. 
</p>

<h1>Methods</h1>

<p>
The capture of the genomic regions of interest using <b>in-solution capture</b>, is achieved 
through the hybridization of a set of probes (oligonucleotides) with a sample of fragmented genomic 
DNA in a solution environment. The probes hybridize selectively to the genomic regions of interest 
which, after a process of exclusion of the non-selective DNA material, can be pulled down and 
sequenced, enabling selective DNA sequencing of the genomic regions of interest (e.g., exons).
In-solution capture sequencing is a sensitive method to detect single nucleotide variants, 
insertions and deletions, and copy number variations.
