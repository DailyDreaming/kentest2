<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The
<a target="_blank" href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/GTEx/index">
NIH Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project</a>
determined genetic variation and gene expression in 52 tissues and 2 cell lines
using RNA-seq data (V8, August 2019), on 17,382 samples from 948 adults.
This track focuses on the gene expression part. It shows read coverage, from one
single sample per tissue, selected for high-quality and high read depth.
The data is summarized to one number per base pair, the number of sequencing
reads that cover this position. The plot allows finding out if a given exon is
transcribed primarily in certain tissues and also whether transcription is
uniform over the length of a single exon.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions</H2>
<P>
This track follows the display conventions for composite 
&quot;wiggle&quot; tracks. The subtracks, one per tissue, of this track 
may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects of the 
displayed data. The graphical configuration options are shown at the top of 
the track description page, followed by a list of subtracks.  To display only 
selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide. 
For more information about the graphical configuration options, click the 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgWiggleTrackHelp.html" TARGET=_blank>Graph
configuration help</A> link.</P>
Tissue colors were assigned to conform to the GTEx Consortium publication conventions.
</P>

In Dense mode, the darkness of the grayscale rectangle displayed for the gene reflects the absolute
read count.
</p>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<p>For background information about GTEx sample selection, see our 
<a href="hgGtexTrackSettings?g=gtexGeneV8" target=_blank>GTEx gene expression
track</a>. In short, samples were sequenced with the Illumina TrueSeq protocol
on unstranded polyA+ librarires to obtain 76-bp paired end reads with
HiSeq 2000 and 2500 machines.</p>

<p>
Sequence reads were aligned to the hg38/GRCh38 human genome using STAR v2.5.3a
and the GENCODE 26 transcriptome. 
The alignment pipeline is available
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/gtex-pipeline/tree/master/rnaseq">here</a>.
For further method details, see the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://gtexportal.org/home/documentationPage#staticTexAnalysisMethods">
GTEx Portal Documentation</a> page.
</p>

<P>
To obtain read coverage, the GTEx Laboratory, Data Analysis and Coordinating
Center (LDACC) at the Broad Institute decided to select a single, high-quality
representative sample for each tissue type, since aggregated tracks may
obscure certain features or even introduce some artifacts (e.g. intronic
coverage). For each tissue, the selected sample has the highest RIN value with
a high coverage (&gt;80M reads) and exonic rate (&gt;85%). 
The alignment-to-coverage pipeline is available from Github:
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/gtex-pipeline/blob/master/rnaseq/src/bam2coverage.py">Python script</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/gtex-pipeline/blob/master/rnaseq/Dockerfile">Docker file</a> and 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/gtex-pipeline/blob/master/rnaseq/bam2coverage.wdl">Pipeline WDL description</a>.

under &quot;bigDataUrl&quot; includes the identifier.</p>

<H2>Subject and Sample Characteristics</H2>
<P>
The scientific goal of the GTEx project required that the donors and their biospecimen 
present with no evidence of disease. 
The tissue types collected were chosen based on their clinical significance, logistical 
feasibility and their relevance to the scientific goal of the project and the 
research community. 
Summary plots of GTEx sample characteristics are available at the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://gtexportal.org/home/tissueSummaryPage">

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The raw data for the GTEx Read Coverage track can be accessed interactively through the 
<a href="hgTables?db=$db&hgta_track=$db&hgta_group=allTables&hgta_table=gtexCov">Table Browser</a>.
</p>
</p>
For automated analysis and downloads, the track data files can be downloaded from 
<a href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/gtex/cov/">our downloads server</a>
or <a href="../goldenPath/help/api.html">the JSON API</a>.
Individual regions or the whole genome annotation can be accessed as text using our utility
<code>bigBedToBed</code>. Instructions for downloading the utility can be found 
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">here</a>. 
That utility can also be used to obtain features within a given range, e.g. 
<code>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/hg38/gtex/gtexGeneV8.bb -chrom=chr21
-start=0 -end=100000000 stdout</code></p>
