<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows selected non-coding Affy transcribed fragments 
(transfrags) and Yale transcriptionally-active regions (TARs) from
the Affy Transfrags and Yale TAR annotation tracks, grouped into subsets based 
on their proximity to the transcript-coding and exon-coding regions of Gencode 
genes.  The transfrags/TARs are divided into four categories:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Intergenic distal subtracks:</B> Transfrags/TARS in the intergenic ENCODE 
areas, <em>i.e.</em> outside the transcript-coding region of any Gencode 
gene and at least 5000 base pairs distant from any Gencode gene exon-coding 
region.
<LI>
<B>Intergenic proximal subtracks:</B> Transfrags/TARS in the intergenic ENCODE 
regions that are close to Gencode genes, <em>i.e.</em> outside
the transcript-coding region of any Gencode gene, but within 5000 bases of 
a Gencode gene exon-coding region.
<LI>
<B>Intronic distal subtracks:</B> Transfrags/TARS within Gencode genes introns,
<em>i.e.</em> within the transcript-coding region of a Gencode gene, 
but at least 5000 base pairs distant from the exon-coding region of any Gencode 
gene.
<LI>
<B>Intronic proximal subtracks:</B> Transfrags/TARS within Gencode genes introns
that are close to Gencode genes exons, <em>i.e.</em> within the 
transcript-coding region of a Gencode gene and also within 5000 bases of a
Gencode gene exon-coding region.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This annotation track is comprised of subtracks that show
different aspects of the displayed data. The complete list of subtracks 
is displayed near the top of the track description page.  </P>
<P>To display only selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks 
you wish to hide. The &quot;Select subtracks&quot; section allows you to select
or unselect entire groups of subtracks based on a particular data 
characteristic, such as distance and region, cell type, data source, 
<em>etc</em>. To add or remove an entire subgroup of data from the graphical 
display, click the appropriate <em>add</em> or <em>clear</em> button.</P>
<P>
Color differences among the subtracks are arbitrary. They provide a
visual cue for distinguishing among the different data sets and subgroups. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
This annotation track was derived from data contained in the Yale TAR and
Affy Transfrags annotation tracks using the UCSC Table Browser. See the 
description pages associated with these annotation tracks for more information 
about the data sets. </P>
