<b>S</b>erial <b>A</b>nalysis of <b>G</b>ene <b>E</b>xpression (SAGE)
is a quantative measurement gene expression. Data is presented for
every cluster contained in the browser window and the selected cluster
name is highlighted in the table. All data are from the repository at the <a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SAGE/" TARGET=_blank>SageMap</a> project
built on UniGene version Hs 159.  

Selecting the UniGene cluster name will display SageMap's page for
that cluster.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2> 
<P>
SAGE counts are produced by sequencing small &quot;tags&quot; of DNA believed to
be associated with a gene. These tags are produced by attatching
poly-A RNA to oligo-dT beads. After synthesis of double stranded cDNA
transcripts are cleaved by an anchoring enzyme (usually NIaIII). Then
small tags are produced by ligation with a linker containing a type
IIS restriction enzyme site and cleavage with the tagging enzyme
(usually BsmFI). The tags are then concatenated together and
sequenced. The frequency of each tag is counted and used to infer
expression level of transcripts that can be matched to that tag.
