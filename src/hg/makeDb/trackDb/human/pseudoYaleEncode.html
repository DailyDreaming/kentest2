<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows pseudogenes identified by the Yale Pseudogene Pipeline in the ENCODE regions.  Pseudogenes
are defined in this analysis as genomic sequences that are similar to
known genes with various inactivating disablements (e.g. premature stop codons
or frameshifts) in their "putative" protein coding regions. Pseudogenes are flagged as either recently processed, recently duplicated, or of uncertain origin (either ancient fragments or resulting from a single-exon parent). 

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Briefly, the protein sequences of known human genes (as annotated by ENSEMBL)
were used to search for similarities, not overlapping with known genes.
It was determined whether the matching sequences were disabled copies of genes based
on the occurrences of premature stop codons or frameshifts.  The
intron-exon structure of the functional gene was further used to infer
whether a pseudogene was recently duplicated or processed. A duplicated
pseudogene retains the intron-exon structure of its parent functional
gene, whereas a processed pseudogene shows evidence that this structure has been spliced out. Small pseudogene sequences that cannot be confidently assigned to either the processed or duplicated category may be ancient fragments. Further details are in the references below. 

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
All pseudogenes in the list have been manually checked.
