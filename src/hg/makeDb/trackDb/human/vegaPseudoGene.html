<H2>Description and Methods </H2>
<P>
This track shows pseudogene annotations from the Vertebrate Genome Annotation 
(Vega) database.</P>
<P>
The following information is excerpted from the
<A HREF="http://vega.archive.ensembl.org/index.html" TARGET=_BLANK>Vertebrate Genome Annotation</A>
home page:</P>
<P>
&quot;The Vega database
is designed to be a central repository for high-quality, frequently updated
manual annotation of different vertebrate finished genome sequence.
Vega attempts to present consistent high-quality curation of the published
chromosome sequences. Finished genomic sequence is analysed on a
clone-by-clone basis using
a combination of similarity searches against DNA and protein databases
as well as a series of <em>ab initio</em> gene predictions (GENSCAN, Fgenes).
The annotation is based on supporting evidence only.&quot;</P>
<P>
&quot;In addition, comparative analysis using vertebrate datasets such as
the Riken mouse cDNAs and Genoscope <em>Tetraodon nigroviridis</em> Ecores
(Evolutionary Conserved Regions) are used for novel gene discovery.&quot;</P>
<P>
NOTE: VEGA annotations do not appear on every chromosome in this assembly.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track follows the display conventions for
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay">gene prediction
tracks</A> using the following color scheme to indicate the status of the gene
annotation:
<UL>
<LI><B>Known</B> (Dark blue): genes that are identical to known human
complementary DNA or protein sequences and have an entry in the
species-specific model organism database.
<LI><B>Novel</B> (Dark blue): genes that have an open reading
frame (ORF) and are identical or homologous to human cDNAs, human ESTs,
or proteins in all species.  Novel transcripts are genes that fit the
criteria of novel genes with the exception that an unambiguous ORF cannot be
assigned.
<LI><B>Putative</B> (Medium blue): genes whose sequences are identical or
homologous to human ESTs but do not contain an ORF.
<LI><B>Predicted</B> (Light blue): genes based on <em>ab initio</em> prediction and
for which at least one exon is supported by biological data (unspliced ESTs,
protein sequence similarity with mouse or tetraodon genomes, or
expression data from Rosetta).
<LI><B>Unclassified</B> (Gray).
</UL></P>
<P>
The details pages show the only the Vega gene type and not the transcript type.
A single gene can have more than one transcript which can belong to
different classes, so the gene as a whole is classified according to the
transcript with the &quot;highest&quot; level of classification. Transcript
type (and other details) may be found by clicking on the transcript
identifier which forms the outside link to the Vega transcript details page.
Further information on the gene and transcript classification may be found
