<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows a tiling path of PCR amplicons, along with their raw DNaseI
sensitivity scores, across all ENCODE 
regions. It is one of a set of tracks that annotate continuous DNaseI 
sensitivity measurements and DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) over the ENCODE 
regions. 
DNaseI has long been used to map general chromatin accessibility and the 
DNaseI &quot;hyperaccessibility&quot; or &quot;hypersensitivity&quot; that is a 
universal feature of active <em>cis</em>-regulatory sequences.
The data were produced using quantitative chromatin profiling (QCP) 
(Dorschner <em>et al.</em>, 2004).
</P> 
<P>
DNaseI-treated and untreated chromatin samples from the following cell 
lines/phenotypes were studied:  
<UL>
<LI>GM06990 (lymphoblastoid; all regions)</LI>
<LI>CaCo2 (intestinal; most regions)</LI>
<LI>SK-N-SH (neural; most regions)</LI>
<LI>HepG2 (hepatic; ENm003/Apolipoprotein A1 locus)</LI>
<LI>Huh7 (hepatic; ENm003, ENr131, ENr213, ENr321)</LI>
<LI>K562 (erythroid; ENm009/Beta-globin locus)</LI>
<LI>ERY (CD34-derived primary adult erythroblasts; ENm009/Beta-globin locus)</LI>
</UL></P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The display is separated into &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot; amplicons,   
to provide a visually distinct appearance among amplicons, so that
adjacent amplicons are always in different subtracks. The details page 
for each amplicon reveals its 
start/stop coordinates and its raw DNaseI sensitivity score.
The score is calculated by the formula  <TT>(copies in DNaseI-treated / copies 
in DNaseI-untreated) * 1000</TT>.</P>
<P>
The graphical display may be filtered to show only those items 
with unnormalized scores that meet or exceed a certain threshhold. To set a 
threshhold, type the minimum score into the text box at the top of the 
description page.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
QCP was performed as described in Dorschner <em>et al</em>. 
PCR amplicons of ~250 bp in size were tiled end-to-end across the study regions.
An amplicon tiling path has been computed over all regions and is available 
through <A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=unists"
TARGET=_blank>UniSTS</A>.</P>
<P>
Chromatin preparation and DNaseI treatment were
performed on the cell types list above as described in 
Dorschner <em>et al</em>. High-throughput real-time PCR was used to quantify 
DNaseI at each amplicon by measuring copies remaining in DNaseI-treated 
<em>vs.</em> untreated samples. The results were then analyzed with a 
statistical algorithm to compute the moving baseline of mean DNaseI sensitivity 
and to identify outliers that correspond with DNaseI hypersensitive sites.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
QCP measurements were performed in replicate (6X) on pooled biological 
replicate samples.  Validation of the results was carried out by conventional 
DNaseI hypersensitivity assays using end-labeling/Southern blotting. A total of 
1.17 Mb have been evaluated by conventional assay. </P>
<P>
The specificity was defined as the number of true negative evaluable QCP 
amplicons divided by the sum of the true negatives plus false positives. Using 
246.2 Kb from ENm002, the specificity was calculated to be 0.997. The 
sensitivity of the QCP assay was calculated as the true positives divided by 
the sum of the true positives plus false negatives.  The sensitivity measured 
for ENm002 was 0.9487.</P>
