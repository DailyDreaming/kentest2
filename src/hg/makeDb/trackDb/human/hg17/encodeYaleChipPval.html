maskless photolithographic arrays. The arrays consist of 50-mer 
oligonucleotides tiled with 12-nt overlaps covering most of the 
non-repetitive DNA sequence of the ENCODE regions. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation was carried out for each experiment using antibodies 
against the following targets: BAF155, BAF170, INI1/BAF47, c-Fos, c-Jun, 
TAF1/TAFII250, RNA polymerase II, histone H4 tetra-acetylated lysine 
(H4Kac4), histone H3 tri-methylated lysine (H3K27me3), STAT1, nuclear factor 
kappa B (NFKB) p65, SMARCA4/BRG1, SMARCA6 and NRSF. Additionally, HeLa S3 cells 
immunoprecipitated with STAT1 were pre-treated with interferon-alpha and 
HeLa S3 cells immunoprecipitated with NFKB antibody were pre-treated with 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (see table below).
<P>
This track shows the combined results of three or four multiple biological
replicates. For all arrays, the ChIP DNA was labeled with Cy5 and the
control DNA was labeled with Cy3. These data are available at

  <TD>BAF155 (Brg1-Associated Factor, 155 kD) is a human homolog of yeast 
SWI3. The Swi-Snf chromatin-remodeling complex was first described in yeast, 
and similar proteins have been found in mammalian cells. The human Swi-Snf
complex is comprised of at least nine polypeptides, including two ATPase
subunits, Brm and Brg-1. Other members of the human Swi-Snf complex are
termed BAFs for Brg1-associated factors. BAF155 is a conserved
(core) component that stimulates the chromatin remodeling activity of
Brg1.</TD>

  <TD>c-Fos (transcription factor) is the cellular homolog of the v-fos 
viral oncogene. It is a member of the leucine zipper protein family and its 
transcriptional activity has been implicated in cell growth, differentiation, 
and development. Fos is induced by many stimuli, ranging from mitogens to 
pharmacological agents. c-Fos has been shown to be associated with another 
proto-oncogene, c-Jun, and together they bind to the AP-1 binding site to 
regulate gene transcription. Like CREB, c-Fos is regulated by p90Rsk.</TD>

The subtracks within this annotation 
may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects of the 
displayed data. The graphical configuration options are shown at the top of 
the track description page, followed by a list of subtracks.  To display only 
selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P> 
The data from replicates were quantile-normalized and median-scaled to each
other (both Cy3 and Cy5 channels). Using a 1000 bp sliding window centered
on each oligonucleotide probe, a signal map (estimating the fold enrichment
[log2 scale] of ChIP DNA) was generated by computing the pseudomedian
signal of all log2(Cy5/Cy3) ratios (median of pairwise averages) within the
window, including replicates. Using the same procedure, a -log10(P-value)
map (measuring significance of enrichment of oligonucleotide probes in the
window) for all sliding windows was made by computing P-values using the
Wilcoxon paired signed rank test comparing fluorescent intensity between
Cy5 and Cy3 for each oligonucleotide probe (Cy5 and Cy3 signals from the
same array). A binding site was determined by thresholding oligonucleotide
positions with -log10(P-value) (>= 4), extending qualified positions
upstream and downstream 250 bp, and requiring 1000 bp space between two
sites. Top 400 sites are retained.

<H2> Verification </H2>
<P>
ChIP-chip binding sites were verified by comparing "hit lists" generated
from combinations of different biological replicates. Only experiments that
yielded a significant overlap (greater than 50 percent) were accepted. As
an independent check (for maskless arrays), data on the microarray were
randomized with respect to position and re-scored; significantly fewer hits
(consistent with random noise) were generated this way.

These data were generated and analyzed by the labs of Michael Snyder, Mark
Gerstein and Sherman Weissman at Yale University.
