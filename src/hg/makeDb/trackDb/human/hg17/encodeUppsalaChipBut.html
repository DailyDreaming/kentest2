<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
ENCODE regions were investigated by ChIP-chip, analyzing both histone H3
acetylation (H3ac; H3 acetylated lysines 9 and14) and histone H4 acetylation
(H4ac; H4 acetylated lysined 5,8,12,16). This analysis was performed using
ChIP material obtained from cells that were either untreated or treated with
5mM Na-Butyrate for 12 hours. Na-Butyrate is a histone deacetylase inhibitor
(HDACi) that increases bulk levels of acetylated histones. Four tracks presented
in the genome browser represent the ChIP-chip signal obtained for either H3ac or
H4ac, using cells that were untreated or treated with butyrate: H3ac 0h, H3ac 12h,
H4ac 0h, H4ac 12h. Two additional tracks indicate those spots where H3ac or H4ac
levels are significantly changed by butyrate treatment.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Chromatin immunoprecipitation, DNA labelling and array hybridization were exactly
as previously described (Rada-Iglesias, <em>et al.</em> 2005). A set of enriched
spots was obtained for each of H3ac 0h, H3ac 12h, H4ac 0h and H4ac 12h using the
same pre-processing and analysis procedures as in (Rada-Iglesias, <em>et al.</em>).
Enriched spots showing different histone acetylation levels between 0h and 12h treatment
were then detected through an empirical Bayes method (Smyth). All spots with B-score>0 were
either classified as <em>up</em> or <em>down</em> depending on whether the acetylation
was increased or decreased. For spots missing all measurements at one of the time
points due to filtering, the B-score was instead calculated on un-filtered, print-tip
lowess normalized (Yang, <em>et al.</em>) raw data. Enriched spots that were not present
in any of the <em>up</em> or <em>down</em> groups were classified as <em>unchanged</em>.

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
New ChIPs were performed for both H3ac and H4ac, both for untreated cells and cells treated
with 5mM Na-butyrate for 12 hours. Furthermore, ChIP was performed in cells that were treated
with 5mM Na-butyrate for 15 minutes, 2 hours, 6 hours and 12 hours+6 hours without butyrate.
All these ChIP DNAs were analyzed by PCR, including 10 regions were loss of acetylation after
12 hours butyrate treatment was observed in ChIP-chip experiments, two regions where a trend
towards increase acetylation was observed, one negative region where no acetylation and no
change was observed and three control regions not included in the ENCODE array and covering
promoter regions of previously known butyrate-responsive genes.
