<P>
This track shows predicted gene fragments based on predictions of
individual conserved exons from the exoniphy program.  The exon predictions
shown in the `exoniphy' track for this assembly (based on hg16/mm3/rn3
alignments and mapped to hg17) were used.  Exons were strung together into
gene fragments by a simple program called `stringiphy': essentially, any
two consecutive predicted exons were joined that were on the same strand,
were less than 20 kb apart, had consistent reading-frame phase, and were not
separated by predicted start or stop codons.  Exons overlapping predicted
pseudogenes and exons not falling on the human/mouse syntenic net were
discarded before running stringiphy.
