<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
ChIP analysis was performed using antibodies to E2F1, c-Myc, TAFI and PolII
in HeLa, GM06990 and/or HelaS3 cells. 
E2F1 and c-Myc protein are transcription factors related to growth.
E2F1 is important in controlling cell division, and c-Myc is associated
with cell proliferation and neoplastic disease. 
TAFI is a general transcription factor that is a key part of the pre-initiation 
complex found on the promoter. PolII is RNA polymerase II. 
</P>
<P>
For E2F1 and c-Myc, three independently crosslinked preparations of HeLa cells
were used to provide three independent biological replicates.  ChIP
assays were performed (with minor modifications which can be provided
upon request) using the protocol found at
<A HREF="https://genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/" TARGET=_blank>The Farnham 
Laboratory</A>.  Array hybridizations were performed using standard
<A HREF="https://sequencing.roche.com/en/products-solutions/by-category/target-enrichment/hybridization.html" TARGET=_blank>NimbleGen Systems</A> 
conditions.</P>
<P>
For TAFI and PolII, crosslinked cells were officially supplied by the ENCODE 
Consortium (for reference, see 
<A HREF="https://www.coriell.org/1/NIGMS"> 
The Human Genetic Cell Repository</A>). 
Hence, this data may be compared to other tracks using this exact 
source of cells. (Note that this is different from the E2F1 and c-myc 
subtracks &mdash; those Hela cells were grown in the Farnham lab.)

ChIP-chip and amplification procedures are according to standard protocols 
available in detail from the 
<A HREF="https://genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/" TARGET=_blank>
Farnham Lab</A> website. 
Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) was used for these samples.
Array processing was performed by 
<A HREF="https://sequencing.roche.com/en/products-solutions/by-category/target-enrichment/hybridization.html" TARGET=_blank>NimbleGen, Inc.</A>
The supplied array data is the result of three biological replicates in 
each case.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The subtracks within this annotation 
may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects of the 
displayed data. The graphical configuration options are shown at the top of 
the track description page, followed by a list of subtracks.  To display only 
selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Ratio intensity values (antibody vs. total) for each of three biological 
replicates were calculated and converted to log<sub>2</sub>.  Each set 
of ratio values was then independently scaled by its Tukey biweight mean.  
The three replicates were then combined by taking the median scaled 
log<sub>2</sub> ratio for each oligo.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
For E2F1, primers were chosen to correspond to 13 individual peaks.  
PCR reactions were performed for each of the 13 primer sets using 
amplicons derived from each of three biological samples (39 reactions).  
The PCR reactions confirmed that all of the 13 chosen peaks were bound 
by E2F1 in all three biological samples. </P>
<P>
For PolII, simple verification of the ChIP sample was performed at a known 
positive target (the promoter for POLII) and known negative target 
(the DHFR 3' UTR region). Quantitative PCR verifications of sites are 
in progress.
