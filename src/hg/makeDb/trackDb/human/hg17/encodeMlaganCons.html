<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays different measurements of conservation based on
the <A HREF="http://lagan.stanford.edu/lagan_web/index.shtml" 
TARGET=_blank>MLAGAN</A> multiple sequence alignments of ENCODE regions 
shown in the MLAGAN Alignment track. Two programs &mdash; 
phastCons (phylogenetic hidden-Markov model method), and
<A HREF="http://mendel.stanford.edu/sidowlab/downloads/GERP/index.html"
TARGET=_blank>GERP</A> (Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling)
&mdash; generated the conservation scoring used to create this track. A related 
track, MLAGAN Elements, shows multi-species conserved sequences (MCSs) based on
the conservation measurements displayed in this track.</P>
<P>
For details on the conservation scores generated by each program, refer to the 
individual Methods subsections.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The subtracks within this composite annotation track may be configured in a 
variety of ways to highlight different aspects of the 
displayed data. The graphical configuration options 
are shown at the top of the track description page, followed by a list of 
the subtracks.  A subtrack may be hidden from view by unchecking the box to the
left of the track name in the list.  For more information about the 
graphical configuration options, click the 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgWiggleTrackHelp.html" TARGET=_blank>Graph
configuration help</A> link.</P>
<P>
Color differences among the subtracks are arbitrary; they provide a
visual cue for distinguishing the different gene prediction methods. See the
Methods section for display information specific to each subtrack.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The methods used to create the MLAGAN alignments in the ENCODE
regions are described in the MLAGAN Alignment track description.</P>

<H3>PhastCons</H3>
<P>
The phastCons program predicts conserved elements and produces base-by-base
conservation scores using a two-state phylogenetic hidden Markov model.
The model consists of a state for conserved regions and a 
state for nonconserved regions, each of which is associated with a 
phylogenetic model.  These two models are identical
except that the branch lengths of the conserved phylogeny are 
multiplied by a scaling parameter <em>rho</em> (0 &lt; <em>rho</em> &lt; 1).</P>
<P>
For determining the conservation for the ENCODE 
alignments,  the nonconserved model was estimated 
from four-fold degenerate coding sites within the ENCODE regions using 
the program phyloFit. The parameter <em>rho</em> was then estimated by 
maximum likelihood, conditional on the nonconserved model, using the EM 
algorithm implemented in phastCons.  Parameter estimation was based on 
a single large alignment, constructed by concatenating the 
alignments for all conserved regions.</P>
<P>
PhastCons was run with the options <TT>--expected-lengths 15</TT> and
<TT>--target-coverage 0.01</TT> to obtain the desired level of 
&quot;smoothing&quot; and a final coverage by conserved elements of 5%.</P>
<P>
The conservation score at each base is the posterior probability that the
base was generated by the conserved state of the phylo-HMM.  It can
be interpreted as the probability that the base is in a conserved
element, given the assumptions of the model and the estimated parameters.
Scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores corresponding to
higher levels of conservation.  </P>
<P>
More details on phastCons can be found in Siepel <em>et. al.</em> (2005)
cited below.</P>

<H3>GERP</H3>
<P>
The GERP score is the expected substitution rate minus the observed substitution
rate at a particular human base. Scores are estimated on a column-by-column 
basis using multiple sequence alignments of mammalian genomic DNA.
The scores are both positive and negative, with negative values (<em>i.e.</em> 
observed &gt; expected) corresponding to neutral or unconstrained sites and 
positive values (<em>i.e.</em> observed &lt; expected) corresponding to 
constrained or slowly evolving sites. 
The expected and observed rates are both calculated on a phylogenic tree using 
the same fixed topology. 
The branch lengths of the expected tree are based on the average substitutions 
at neutral sites. 
The branch lengths of the observed tree, which is calculated separately for 
each human base, are based on the substitutions seen at the column of the 
multiple alignment at that base. 
Species that have gaps at a particular column are not considered in the scoring 
for that column.</P>
<P>
Higher scores correspond to human
bases in alignment columns with higher degrees of similarity, <em>i.e.</em>
bases that have evolved slowly, some of which have been under purifying 
selection. The opposite holds true for swiftly evolving (low similarity) 
columns. </P>
<P>
Scores are deterministic, given a maximum-likelihood model of
nucleotide substitution, species topology, neutral tree, and alignment.</P>
