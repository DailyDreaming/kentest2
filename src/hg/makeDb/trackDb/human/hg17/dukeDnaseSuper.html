<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
This super-track combines related tracks of DNaseI
sensitivity data from Duke University.
These tracks contain DNaseI analysis of CD4+ T-cells, using DNase-sequencing
and DNase-chip methods.
CD4+ T-cells, also known as helper or inducer T cells, 
are involved in generating an immune response. 
CD4+ T-cells are also one of the primary targets of the HIV virus.

DNaseI has long been used to map general chromatin accessibility and
the DNaseI &quot;hyperaccessibility&quot; or &quot;hypersensitivity&quot;
that is a universal feature of active <em>cis</em>-regulatory sequences.
The use of this method has led to the discovery of functional
regulatory elements that
include enhancers, insulators, promotors, locus control regions and novel
elements. DNaseI hypersensitivity signifies chromatin accessibility following
binding of trans-acting factors in place of a canonical nucleosome,
and is a universal feature of active cis-regulatory sequences in vivo.</P>
