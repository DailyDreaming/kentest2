<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows DNaseI sensitivity measured across ENCODE regions using
the Quantitative Chromatin Profiling (QCP) method (Dorschner <em>et al.</em> 
(2004)). DNaseI has long been used to map general chromatin accessibility and 
the DNaseI &quot;hyperaccessibility&quot; or &quot;hypersensitivity&quot; 
that is a universal feature of active <em>cis</em>-regulatory sequences. 
The use of this method has lead to the discovery of functional 
regulatory elements that 
include enhancers, insulators, promotors, locus control regions and novel 
elements. QCP provides a quantitative high-throughout method for the 
mapping DNaseI sensitivity as a continuous function of genome position. The 
moving baseline of mean DNaseI sensitivity is computed using a 
locally-weighted least squares (LOWESS)-based algorithm.</P>

DNaseI-treated and untreated chromatin samples from the following cell 
lines/phenotypes were studied:

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
DNaseI sensitivity is expressed in standard units, where each
increment of 1 unit corresponds to an increase of 1 standard deviation 
from the baseline.
The displayed values are calculated as <TT>copies in DNaseI-untreated / copies 
in DNaseI-treated</TT>. Thus, increasing values represent increasing 
sensitivity.  Major DNaseI hypersensitive sites are readily identified as
peaks in the signal that exceed 2 standard deviations (corresponding to 
the ~95% confidence
bound on outliers). This is reflected in the default viewing parameters, 
which apply a lower y-axis threshold of 2 (i.e., showing only sites that 
exceed the 95% confidence bound).</P>
<P>
The subtracks within this composite annotation track correspond to data
from different tissues, and may be configured in a variety of ways to 
highlight different aspects of the displayed data. Four tissue types
are present throughout all ENCODE regions: GM06990, CaCo2, HeLa, and SKnSH. 
Several 
Relevant tissues were also studied for several ENCODE regions that contain
tissue-specific genes. These include the alpha- and beta-globin loci 
(ENm008 and ENm009); the apolipoprotein A1/C3 loci (ENm003); and the Th2 
cytokine locus (ENm002). Color differences among the subtracks are 
arbitrary; they provide a visual cue for distinguishing the different cell 
lines/phenotypes.</P>
<P>
The graphical configuration options are shown at the top of the track 
description page, followed by a list of subtracks.  To display only selected 
subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide. For more

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
QCP was performed as described in Dorschner <em>et al</em>. Data 
were obtained from a tiling path across ENCODE that comprises 102,008 
distinct amplicons (mean length = 243 +/- 13). The amplicon tiling path is 
available through 
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=unists"
TARGET=_blank>UniSTS</A>.
The tiling path covers approximately 86% of ENCODE regions, including many 
repetitive regions.  The Dorschner <em>et al.</em> article describes the 
methods of chromatin preparation, DNaseI digestion, and DNA purification 
utilized. DNaseI-treated and -untreated control samples were prepared from 
each tissue.  For each tissue, 6-10 biological replicates (defined as 
replicate cultures grown from seed and harvested on different days) were 
pooled together to create a master sample.  The relative number of intact 
copies of the genomic DNA sequence was quantified over the entire tiling path 
real-time PCR for both DNaseI-treated and -untreated samples.  Four to eight 
technical 
replicates were performed for each measurement from each amplicon in each 
tissue.  Data shown are the means of these technical replicates.  The results 
were analyzed as described in Dorschner <em>et al.</em> to compute the moving 
baseline of mean DNaseI sensitivity and to identify outliers that 
correspond with DNaseI hypersensitive sites.  The standard deviation of 
trimmed mean measurements was used to convert data to standard units. 
</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
Biological replicate samples were pooled as described above.  Results were 
extensively validated by conventional DNaseI hypersensitivity assays 
using end-labeling/Southern blotting method (Navas <em>et al.</em>, 
in preparation).
