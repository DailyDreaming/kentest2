<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays DNaseI-hypersensitive sites identified using DNase-chip from three different human cell lines (primary CD4+ T cells, GM06990 lymphoblastoid cell line, and HeLa S3 cervical carcinoma cell line). DNaseI-hypersensitive sites are associated with all types of gene regulatory regions, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, and locus control regions.
<P>
RAW data represents averaged log2 ratio data from three biological replicates and three different DNase concentrations.
<P>
PVAL data represents significant regions that likely represent valid DNase I hypersensitive sites.  Values represent -log10 p values as determined by the ACME (Algorithm for Capturing Microarray Enrichment) program (Scacheri, Crawford, and Davis, 2006).  The higher the -log10 p values, the darker the region (and more likely the site is to be hypersensitive).  Only regions that have p value &lt; 0.001 are shown.
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
DNaseI hypersensitive sites were isolated using a method called DNase-chip (Crawford et al., 2006). Briefly, DNaseI digested ends from intact chromatin were captured using three different DNase concentrations as well as three biological replicates. This material was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to NimbleGen ENCODE tiled microarrays.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
To display only selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide. The display may also be filtered to show only those items with unnormalized scores that meet or exceed a certain threshhold. To set a threshhold, type the minimum score into the text box at the top of the description page.
