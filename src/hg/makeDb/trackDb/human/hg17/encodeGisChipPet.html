<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows genome-wide p53 binding sites as determined by chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and paired-end di-tag (PET) sequencing.  
The p53 protein is a transcription factor involved in the control 
of cell growth that is often expressed at high levels in cancer cells.  
See the Methods section below for more information about ChIP and
PET.</P>
<P>
The PET sequences in this track are derived from 65,572
individual p53 ChIP fragments of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) stimulated
HCT116 cells. More datasets will be submitted in the future, including
STAT1, TAF250, and E2F1.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
In the graphical display, PET sequences are shown as two blocks,
representing the ends of the pair, connected by a thin arrowed
line. Overlapping PET clusters (PET fragments that overlap one
another) originating from the ChIP enrichment process define the
genomic loci that are potential transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). 
PET singletons, from non-specific ChIP fragments that did not cluster, are 
not shown.</P>
<P>
In full and packed display modes, the arrowheads on the horizontal line 
represent the orientation of the PET sequence, and an ID of the format 
<em>XXXXX-M</em> is shown to the left of each PET,
where <em>X</em> is the unique ID for each PET 
and <em>M</em> is the number of PET sequences at this location.
The track coloring reflects the value of <em>M</em>: 
light gray indicates one or two sequences (score = 333), dark gray is used for 
three sequences (score = 800) and black indicates four or more PET sequences 
(score = 1000) at the location.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
HCT116 cells were treated with 5FU for six hours. The cross-linked
chromatin was sheared and precipitated with a high affinity
antibody. The DNA fragments were end-polished and cloned into the plasmid
vector, pGIS3. pGIS3 contains two <I>MmeI</I> recognition sites that
flank the cloning site, which were used to produce a 36 bp
PET from the original ChIP DNA fragments (18 bp from each of the 5' and 3' 
ends). Multiple 36 bp PETs were concatenated and cloned into pZero-1 for 
sequencing, where each sequence read can generate 10-15 PETs. The PET 
sequences were extracted from raw sequence reads and mapped to the genome, 
defining the boundaries of each ChIP DNA fragment.  The following specific
mapping criteria were used:
<UL>
<LI>both 5' and 3' signatures must be present on the same chromosome
<LI>their 5' to 3' orientation must be correct
<LI>a minimal 17 bp match must exist for each 18 bp 5' and 3' signature
<LI>the tags must have genomic alignments within 4 Kb of each other
</UL></P>
<P>
Due to the known possibility of <I>MmeI</I> slippage (+/- 1 bp) that
leads to ambiguities at the PET signature boundaries, a minimal 17 bp
match was set for each 18 bp signature.  The total count of PET sequences
mapped to the same locus but with slight nucleotide differences may reflect
the expression level of the transcripts. Only PETs with specific mapping 
(one location) to the genome were considered.  PETs that mapped to multiple 
locations may represent low complexity or repetitive sequences, and therefore 
were not included for further analysis.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Statistical and experimental verification exercises have shown that
the overlapping PET clusters result from ChIP enrichment events.
<P>
Monte Carlo simulation using the p53 ChIP-PET data estimated that
about 27% of PET-2 clusters (PET clusters with two overlapping
members), 3% of the PET clusters with 3 overlapping members (PET-3
clusters), and less than 0.0001% of PET clusters with more than 3
overlapping members were due to random chance. This suggests that the
PET clusters most likely represent the real enrichment events by ChIP
and that a higher number of overlapping fragments correlates to a
higher probability of a real ChIP enrichment event. Furthermore, based
on goodness-of-fit analysis for assessing the reliability of PET
clusters, it was estimated that less than 36% of the PET-2 clusters
and over 99% of the PET-3+ clusters (clusters with three or more
overlapping members) are true enrichment ChIP sites. Thus, the
verification rate is nearly 100% for PET-3+ ChIP clusters, and the
PET-2 clusters contain significant noise.</P>
<P>
In addition to these statistical analyses, 40 genomic locations
identified by PET-3+ clusters were randomly selected and analyzed by
quantitative real-time PCR. The relative enrichment of candidate
regions compared to control GST ChIP DNA was determined and all 40
regions (100%) were confirmed to have significant enrichment of p53
ChIP clusters. </P>
