<P>
Although the information of cDNAs is indispensable for analyzing gene
function, most of the cDNA sequences stored in <BR>
current databases are imperfect in the sense that they lack the precise
information of 5' end termini. To overcome this <BR>
difficulty, a team at the Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science,
University of Tokyo developed an oligo-capping <BR> 
method to obtain full-length cDNAs, the information of which has been
partly deposited in public databases.  In this <BR> 
study, they further constructed human cDNA libraries enriched in clones
containing the cap structure to systematically <BR> 
explore the 5' end structure of expressed genes. Of about 284,687 5' end
sequences obtained, 155,304 corresponded to <BR>
cDNA sequences of known genes (8,996 genes) and are presented in the
<A HREF="http://dbtss.hgc.jp/" TARGET=_blank>
DataBase of Transcriptional Start Sites</A> (DBTSS).<BR>
Sequence comparison between the DBTSS entries and those of the reference
sequence database, RefSeq, revealed that <BR>
4,802 (34.2 %) of RefSeq sequences should be extended towards the 5' ends.
The team also mapped each sequence on <BR>
the human draft genome sequence to identify its transcriptional start site,
which provided more detailed information <BR>
on distribution patterns of transcriptional start sites and adjacent
regulatory regions.
