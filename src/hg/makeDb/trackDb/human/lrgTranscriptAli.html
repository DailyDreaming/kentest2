<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the fixed (unchanging) transcript(s) associated with
each 
<A HREF="http://www.lrg-sequence.org/"
TARGET=_BLANK>Locus Reference Genomic (LRG)</A> sequence.
LRG
sequences are manually curated, stable DNA sequences that surround a
locus (typically a gene) and provide an unchanging coordinate system
for reporting sequence variants.  They are not necessarily identical
to the corresponding sequence in a particular reference genome
assembly (such as $date), but can be mapped to each version of a
reference genome assembly in order to convert between the stable LRG
variant coordinates and the various assembly coordinates.
</P>
<P>
The LRG Regions track, in the Mapping and Sequencing Tracks section,
includes more information about the LRG including the HGNC gene symbol
for the gene at that locus, source of the LRG sequence, and summary of
differences between LRG sequence and the genome assembly.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
LRG sequences are suggested by the community studying a locus (for example,
Locus-Specific Database curators, research laboratories, mutation consortia).
LRG curators then examine the submitted transcript as well as other known
transcripts at the locus, in the context of alignment and public expression
data.
For more information on the selection and annotation process, see the 
<A HREF="http://www.lrg-sequence.org/faq/" TARGET=_BLANK>LRG FAQ</A>,
(Dalgleish, <em>et al.</em>) and (MacArthur, <em>et al.</em>).
