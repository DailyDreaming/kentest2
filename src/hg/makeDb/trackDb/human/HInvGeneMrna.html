<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows alignments of full-length cDNAs that were used as the basis 
of the <A HREF="http://www.h-invitational.jp/hinv/ahg-db/index.jsp"
TARGET=_blank>H-Invitational Gene Database</A> (HInv-DB).  
The HInv-DB is a human gene database containing human-curated annotation of 
41,118 full-length cDNA clones representing 21,037 cDNA clusters.
The project was initiated in 2002 and the database became publicly
available in April 2004.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
To cluster redundant cDNAs and alternative splicing variants within the H-Inv 
cDNAs, a total of 41,118 H-Inv cDNAs were mapped to the human genome using 
the mapping pipeline developed by the Japan Biological Information Research
Center (JBIRC). The mapping yielded 40,140 cDNAs that 
were aligned against the genome using the stringent criteria of at least 95% 
identity and 90% length coverage. These 40,140 cDNAs were clustered to 20,190 
loci, resulting in an average of 2.0 cDNAs per locus. For the remaining 978 
unmapped cDNAs, cDNA-based clustering was applied, yielding 847 clusters. 
In total, 21,037 clusters (20,190 mapped and 847 unmapped) were identified 
and integrated into H-InvDB. H-Inv cluster IDs (e.g. HIX0000001) were
assigned  to these clusters. A representative sequence was selected from each 
cluster and used for further analyses and annotation.</P>

report by the H-Inv Consortium (see References section).</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
The H-InvDB is hosted at the JBIRC.
The human-curated annotations were produced during invitational annotation
meetings held in Japan during the summer of 2002, with a follow-up
meeting in November 2004.  Participants included 158 scientists 
representing 67 institutions from 12 countries.</P>
<P>
The full-length cDNA clones and sequences were produced by the
Chinese National Human Genome Center (CHGC), 
the Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ/MIPS), 
Helix Research Institute, Inc. (HRI), 
the Institute of Medical Science in the University of Tokyo (IMSUT), 
the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (KDRI), 
the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC/NIH) and the
Full-Length Long Japan (FLJ) project.</P>
