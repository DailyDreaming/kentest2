DNaseI has long been used to map general chromatin accessibility and the 
DNaseI &quot;hyperaccessibility&quot; or &quot;hypersensitivity&quot; that is a 
universal feature of active <em>cis</em>-regulatory sequences.
This track annotate DNaseI sensitivity measurements and 
DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) over ENCODE regions. The data were produced 
by UW/Regulome and NHGRI.
