<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This track shows expression data from the Gladstone Institute. 
In full mode all tissues are
displayed.  In packed or dense mode averages of related tissues are shown.
As is standard with microarray data, red indicates overexpression in the 
tissue, and green indicates underexpression.   The data are also available
in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/hgNear">Gene Sorter</A>.

<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>For detailed information about the experiments, see
Abeyta M.J. et al. (2004),
<A HREF="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/13/6/601"

<EM>Hum. Mol. Gen.</EM><B>13</B>(6):601-608.
<P>When calculating expression ratios, the overall expression level in the
denominator were calculated by first taking the median of replicants for
each tissue,  and then taking the median of these medians.
