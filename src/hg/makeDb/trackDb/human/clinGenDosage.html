UCSC presents these data for use by qualified professionals, and even 
such professionals should use caution in interpreting the significance of 
information found here. No single data point should be taken at face 
value and such data should always be used in conjunction with as much 
corroborating data as possible. No treatment protocols should be 
developed or patient advice given on the basis of these data without 
careful consideration of all possible sources of information.

<p>
The <b>ClinGen Dosage Sensitivity</b> dataset shows evidence supporting or refuting 
<b>haploinsufficiency (loss)</b> and <b>triplosensitivity (gain)</b> as mechanisms for disease at 
gene-level and larger genomic regions.
</p>
<p>
A <b>rating system</b> is used to classify the <b>evidence</b> supporting or refuting dosage 
sensitivity for individual genes and regions, which takes in consideration the following criteria: 
number of causative mutations reported, patterns of inheritance, consistency of phenotype, evidence 
from large-scale case-control studies, mutational mechanisms, data from public genome variation 
databases, and expert consensus opinion.
</p>
<p> 
The system is intended to be of a "dynamic nature", with regions being reevaluated periodically to 
incorporate emerging evidence. The evidence collected is displayed within a publicly available 
<a target="_blank" href="https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/gene-dosage">database</a>. Evidence 
that haploinsufficiency or triplosensitivity of a gene is associated with a specific 
phenotype will aid in the interpretive assessment of CNVs including that gene.
</p>
<p> 
There are two subtracks in this track set:
<ul>
<li><b>ClinGen Haploinsufficiency:</b> genes/regions associations to haploinsufficiency</li>
<li><b>ClinGen Triplosensitivity:</b> genes/regions associations to triplosensitivity</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
<b>Scores</b> are used to classify the evidence of the supporting dosage sensitivity map:
<dl>
<dd><b>0</b> - no evidence available</dd>
<dd><b>1</b> - little evidence for dosage pathogenicity</dd>
<dd><b>2</b> - some evidence for dosage pathogenicity</dd>
<dd><b>3</b> - sufficient evidence for dosage pathogenicity</dd>
<dd><b>30</b> - gene associated with autosomal recessive phenotype</dd>
<dd><b>40</b> - dosage sensitivity unlikely</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>
For more information on the use of the scores see the ClinGen 
<a target="_blank" href="https://clinicalgenome.org/tools/cnv-webinar/faq/">FAQs</a>.
Items are shaded according to dosage sensitivity type. <b><font color="red">red</font></b> for haploinsufficiency,
<b><font color="blue">blue</font></b> for triplosensitivity, <B><font color="#8649c4">violet</font></b> 
for associations with autosomal recessive phenotypes, and <B><font color="#a8a8a8">grey</font></b> 
for genes/regions that have not been evaluated yet or no evidence is available. A light to dark 
gradient color is used according to the degree of supporting evidence. 
</p>
<p>
Mouseover on items shows the supporting evidence of dosage sensitivity and respective scores. All 
tracks can be filtered according to the supporting evidence of dosage sensitivity.

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a>,
or the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>. For automated analysis, the data may 
be queried from our REST API. Please refer to our 
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/soe.ucsc.edu/forum/#!forum/genome">mailing list archives</a>
for questions, or our <a href="../FAQ/FAQdownloads.html#downloads36">Data Access FAQ</a> for more
information.
