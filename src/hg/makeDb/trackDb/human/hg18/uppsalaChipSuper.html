<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
This super-track combines related tracks of genome-wide ChIP-chip data generated by
the Wadelius lab at Uppsala University, Sweden.
These tracks display localization of two transcription factors (USF1 and USF2) and 
acetylated histone H3 (H3ac) in a liver cell line (HepG2), as assayed by
Affymetrix arrays tiled at 35 bp resolution.
For each factor, the average probe level intensities as well as 
identified positive regions are presented.     
<br><br>
The raw data for these tracks is available at <A HREF="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/" TARGET=_blank>EBI ArrayExpress</A>, as experiment E-TABM-314.
