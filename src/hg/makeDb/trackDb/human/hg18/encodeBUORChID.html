<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays the predicted hydroxyl radical cleavage
intensity on naked DNA for each nucleotide in the ENCODE regions.
Because the hydroxyl radical cleavage intensity is proportional to the solvent
accessible surface area of the deoxyribose hydrogen atoms 
(Balasubramanian <em>et al</em>., 1998), this track represents a structural 
profile of the DNA in the ENCODE regions.</P>
<P>
Please visit the <a href="https://dna.bu.edu/orchid/" target="_blank">ORChID</a> web site maintained by the Tullius group for 
access to experimental hydroxyl radical cleavage data, and to a server 
which can be used to predict the cleavage pattern for any input sequence.</P>
<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different 
aspects of the displayed data. The graphical configuration options 
are shown at the top of the track description page.  For more information,

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Hydroxyl radical cleavage intensity predictions were performed using
an in-house sliding tetramer window (STW) algorithm.  This algorithm
draws data from the &middot;OH Radical Cleavage Intensity Database
(ORChID), which contains more than 150 experimentally determined cleavage
patterns.  These predictions are fairly accurate, with a Pearson
coefficient of 0.88 between the predicted and experimentally
determined cleavage intensities.  For more details on the hydroxyl
radical cleavage method, see below for reference (Greenbaum <em>et al.</em> 2007). </P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
The STW algorithm has been cross-validated by removing each test
sequence from the training set and performing a prediction.  The
mean correlation coefficient (between predicted and experimental
cleavage patterns) from this study was 0.88. </P>
