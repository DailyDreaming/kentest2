<H2>Description</H2>

This track shows copy number variation (CNV) in the ENCODE Tier 1 and Tier 2 
human <a href="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=cellType" 
target="_blank">cell lines</a> GM12878, HepG2, and K562 as determined by <A HREF="https://support.illumina.com/array/array_kits/human1m-duo_dna_analysis_kit.html" TARGET=_blank>Illumina's Human 
1M-Duo Infinium HD BeadChip assay</A> and CNV analysis by circular binary segmentation (CBS).
<P>
Two biological replicates were generated for each cell line.
Because biological replicates gave very similar results, 
the replicates were averaged to provide a single genotyping
dataset in order to apply these data to other ENCODE experiments.  
Possible uses of this data are for correction of copy number in 
peak-calling for interactome,
transcriptome, DNase hypersensitivity, and methylome determinations.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track is a multi-view composite track that contains multiple data types
(<EM>views</EM>). For each view, there are multiple subtracks that display 
individually on the browser. Instructions for configuring multi-view tracks are
<A HREF="/goldenPath/help/multiView.html" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>
Cells were grown according to the approved
<A HREF="/ENCODE/protocols/cell" TARGET=_BLANK>ENCODE cell culture protocols</A>.</P>

<H3>Isolation of genomic DNA and hybridization</H3>
Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit according
 to the instructions provided by the manufacturer.  
For each biological replicate of each cell line, DNA concentrations and
a level of quality were determined by UV absorbance.
Genotypes were determined from 400 nanograms of each sample at 1 million loci 
using Illumina Human 1M-Duo arrays and standard Illumina protocols.    

<H3>Processing and Analysis </H3>
Genotypes were ascertained from the 1M-Duo Arrays with BeadStudio using 
default settings and formatting with the A/B genotype designation for each SNP 
(see 1M-Duo manifest file for specific nucleotide).  

Copy Number Variation (CNV) analysis was performed using circular binary 
segmentation (DNAcopy) of the log R ratio values at each probe 
(Olshen et al., 2004).  
The parameters used were alpha=0.001, nperm=5000, sd.undo=1.  
Copy number segments are reported with the mean log R ratio for each 
chromosomal segment called by CBS.  
Log ratios of ~-0.2 to -1.5 can be considered heterozygous deletions,
 < -1.5 homozygous deletions, and > 0.2 amplifications.

The coordinates for the genotypes and copy number calls are from Human Genome Build 36.

<H2>Release Notes</H2>
<p>
Release 2 (April 2011) of this track updates the colors used in the Regions view subtracks (the
data remains unchanged). The colors now adhere to the color standards determined at the first annual
International Standards for Cytogenomic Arrays (ISCA) Scientific Conference.
