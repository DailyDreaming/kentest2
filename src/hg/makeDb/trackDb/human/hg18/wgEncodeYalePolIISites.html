<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Target protein Pol II (Covance 8WG16) was purified by chromatin 
immunoprecipitation from 
<A HREF="https://www.atcc.org/ATCCAdvancedCatalogSearch/ProductDetails/tabid/452/Default.aspx?ATCCNum=CCL-2.2&Template=cellBiology" TARGET=_blank>HeLaS3</A>
(cervix epithelial adenocarcinoma) cells. The series is comprised of three 
biological replicates, done using ChIP-Sequencing on a Solexa machine. DNA 
fragments are selected for sizes in the range of 100-300 bps, then 27nts tags 
are sequenced from the ends of these fragments.
</P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The sequenced tags are mapped onto the hg18 build of the human genome using 
the Eland application (Illumina).  Only tags that map uniquely with at most
two mismatches are included. 7,478,694 tags were mapped uniquely to the genome 
from the combined data from the three biological replicates.
</P>
<P>
87,253 Pol II binding sites were determined using a peak threshold of 7 
overlapping mapped fragments which corresponds to an expected false discovery 
rate of 0.1% as estimated by computer simulation.
