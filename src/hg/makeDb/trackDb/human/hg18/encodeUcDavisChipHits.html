<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
ChIP analysis was performed using antibodies to E2F1 and Myc in HeLa cells. 
E2F1 and Myc protein are transcription factors related to growth. E2F1 is 
important in controlling cell division, and C-Myc is associated with cell 
proliferation and neoplastic disease. Three independently cross-linked 
preparations of HeLa cells were used to provide three independent biological 
replicates. ChIP assays were performed using the protocol found at 
<A HREF="https://genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/protocol.html" TARGET=_blank>
Farnham Lab Protocols</A>.  Array hybridizations 
were performed using standard 
<A HREF="https://sequencing.roche.com/en/products-solutions/by-category/target-enrichment/hybridization.html" TARGET=_blank>NimbleGen Systems</A> 
conditions.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Ratio intensity values (antibody vs. total) for each of three biological 
replicates were calculated and converted to log<sub>2</sub>.  Peaks were 
identified independently for each of the three E2F1 and the three Myc 
ChIP-chip experiments using the 
<A HREF="http://chipanalysis.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/cgi-bin/tamalpais.cgi" TARGET=_blank>
Tamalpais program</A>. 
The identified peaks from the L1 categories for the three E2F1 or three 
Myc experiments were then compared.  All regions reported here as binding 
sites were identified in at least two of the three E2F1 or at least two 
of the three Myc ChIP-chip assays. 
</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Primers were chosen to correspond to 13 individual peaks.  
PCR reactions were performed for each of the 13 primer sets using 
amplicons derived from each of three biological samples (39 reactions).  
The PCR reactions confirmed that all of the 13 chosen peaks were bound 
by E2F1 in all three biological samples. </P>
