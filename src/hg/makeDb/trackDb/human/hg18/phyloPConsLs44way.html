<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows basewise measurements of evolutionary 
conservation/acceleration in particular clades of interest,  <em>relative </em>
to the levels of conservation/acceleration displayed elsewhere in the 
phylogeny. These scores were produced by the <em>phyloP</em> program from the 
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="http://compgen.cshl.edu/phast/">
PHAST package</A> , using the same 
species set, multiz alignment, and neutral model of evolution that were 
used for the main conservation track (see description page for 
"Vertebrate Multiz Alignment &amp; Conservation (44 Species)" track for 
details). The individual scores represent -log p-values for a slow-down 
or speed-up in the estimated evolutionary rate for the clade of 
interest, relative to the estimated rate outside that clade, under a 
null hypothesis of neutral evolution (see Methods). 
</P>
<P>
As with the phyloP 
scores for the main conservation track, positive values indicate a 
decrease in rate (conservation) and negative values indicate an increase 
in rate (acceleration). In this case, however, the score measures a 
<em>change</em> in evolutionary rate in a clade of interest, possibly 
indicating clade-specific selection rather than the absolute rate 
across the phylogeny. Note that this track does not attempt to 
distinguish between negative and positive directional selection. For 
example, a clade-specific increase in rate could be due to 
clade-specific positive selection or relaxation of constraint. 
Similarly, a clade-specific decrease in rate could be due to gain of 
negative selection or loss of positive selection.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The scores were produced by running <em>phyloP</em> with the options --method 
LRT --mode CONACC --wig-scores, and by indicating the clade of interest 
with the --subtree option (see PHAST docs 
<a href="http://compgen.cshl.edu/phast/" target="_blank">
http://compgen.cshl.edu/phast/</a>). The program was given a 
neutral model estimated from fourfold degenerate sites, as decribed for 
the main conservation track. With these options, <em>phyloP</em> performs a 
likelihood ratio test at each alignment column. This test compares a 
null model in which the neutral branch lengths are all scaled by a 
single scaling factor (a free parameter, estimated by maximum 
likelihood), and an alternative model with separate scaling factors for 
the clade of interest and the remainder of the phylogeny (both estimated 
by maximum likelihood). To obtain an approximate p-value, the log 
likelihood ratio of these two hypotheses is compared to an asymptotic 
chi-squared null distribution, in the usual way. Scores are then 
computed as -log 10 p-values. If the estimated rate for the clade of 
interest is greater than the estimated rate outside that clade, the 
score is negated, to indicate acceleration rather than conservation.
