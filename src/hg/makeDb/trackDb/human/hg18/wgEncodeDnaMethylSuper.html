<h2>Description</h2>
<p>DNA methylation is essential for normal development and is
associated with silencing large regions of DNA through processes such
as imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation.&nbsp; The majority of CpG
dinucleotides are methylated in mammals.&nbsp; Unmethylated CpGs occur
in segments called "CpG islands", which often lie in the upstream of
genes in the regulatory regions and impact transcription. <br>
<br>
</p>
<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
These tracks depict the degree of methylation in CpG islands.&nbsp; CpG
islands with stronger methylation scores are rendered in brighter
colors, as described in each track details page.<span

<h2>Credits</h2>
These data were generated and analyzed as part of the <a
 href="http://www.genome.gov/10005107">ENCODE</a> project, a
genome-wide consortium project with the aim of cataloging all
functional elements in the human genome.&nbsp; This effort includes
collecting a variety of data over a specific set of <a
href="/ENCODE/cellTypes.html">cell types</a>.&nbsp;
Consequently,
data
related
to
these tracks be available under ENCODE
tracks. &nbsp;&nbsp;
