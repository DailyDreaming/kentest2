<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Regulatory Factor Binding Regions (RFBRs) were identified from ChIP-Chip 
experimental data; they are non-randomly distributed in the ENCODE regions 
with local enrichment and depletion. By mapping the full set of RFBRs onto the 
human genome sequence, we identified 689 genomic subregions with RFBR 
enrichment and 726 subregions with RFBR depletion (the RFBR clusters and 
deserts, respectively) in the ENCODE regions.

<H2>Methods</H2>

The data set analyzed in this study consists of 105 lists of transcriptional 
regulatory elements (TREs) in the ENCODE regions. It was released on December 
13, 2005 by the Transcriptional Regulation Group. TRE lists made available 
after this data freeze were not included in this study. A total of 29 
transcription factors (BAF155, BAF170, Brg1, CEBPe, CTCF, E2F1, E2F4, H3ac, 
H4ac, H3K27me3, H3K27me3, H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9K14me2, HisH4, c-Jun, 
c-Myc, P300, P63, Pol2, PU1, RARecA, SIRT1, Sp1, Sp3, STAT1, Suz12, and TAF1) 
were assayed by seven laboratories (Affymetrix, Sanger, Stanford, UCD, UCSD, 
UT, Yale) using ChIP-chip experiments on three different microarray 
platforms (Affymetrix tiling array, NimbleGen tiling array, and traditional 
PCR array) in nine cell lines (HL-60, HeLa, GM06990, K562, IMR90, HCT116, THP1, Jurkat, and fibroblasts) or at two different experimental time points 
(P0, before addition of gamma-interferon, and P30, 30 minutes after the 
addition of gamma-interferon). </P>

The raw data from these 105 ChIP-chip experiments was uniformly processed 
using a method based on the false discovery rate (Efron, 2004). Three sets of 
TRE lists were generated at 1%, 5%, and 10% false discovery rates respectively, 
and the list generated at the lowest (1%) false discovery rate was used in 
this study. The non-redundant factor-specific RFBR lists were mapped onto the 
ENCODE regions. Uninterrupted genomic regions that are covered by one or more 
RFBRs were identified as RFBR groups. Neighboring groups that are less than 
1 kb apart were collected into RFBR clusters. Un-clustered groups that are 
covered by more than three RFBRs were promoted into clusters. Further details
of the method may be found in Zhang <em>et al.</em> (2007).

The data set was made available by the Transcriptional Regulation Group of the 
ENCODE Project Consortium. The RFBR cluster and desert tracks were generated 
by Zhengdong Zhang from Mark Gerstein's group at Yale University.
