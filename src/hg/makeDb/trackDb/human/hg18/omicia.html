<H2>Disclaimer</H2>
<P>
The Omicia OMIM track is intended for research purposes.  The data are
obtained from OMIM and mapped by computational methods and/or human annotation,
and may contain errors.
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track contains the OMIM allelic variants mapped to the human genome
sequence.  To obtain a more "genome-centric" view of OMIM and increase 
its usefulness to the community, Omicia has mapped OMIM variants as 
nucleotide changes leading to protein
changes.  Specifically, OMIM allelic variants with headings that refer to
amino acid mutations, e.g., ARG123CYS, and allelic variants that refer to 
mutations within or relative to introns, e.g., IVS1AS G-A -1, are mapped.
<P>
There are two subtracks:  one track, produced for all genes with mappable
allelic variant data within OMIM, where the data are mapped by computational
methods; a second track, determined for approximately 50 genes, where the 
data from the computational mapping method are reviewed and confirmed for 
accuracy, and for which
additional allelic variants that could not be mapped computationally are
mapped by hand.
<H2>Display Conventions</H2>
<P>
The track is color-coded by score.  (See Methods for details on scoring.)
<UL>
<LI>High confidence (score &gt;= 6): green

Validation codes represent specific features of the score.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>For amino acid variants:
<UL>
<LI>d: overlap with dbSNP
<LI>D: overlap with a mutation within dbSNP that was annotated by the NCBI
as this OMIM allele.
<LI>o: overlap with other data sources
<LI>s: required a shifting for the allelic variants to align with the reference
protein sequence.
</UL>
<LI>For intron variants:
<UL>
<LI>i: IVS variant
<LI>x: interpolated, 'AS' or 'DS' inferred from sign of location
<LI>f: far, deep into intron (beyond 2 residues from the splice site).
<LI>o: outside splice site

Automated mapping and scoring of amino acid variants (e.g., ARG123CYS)
<P>
Often this is non-trivial since protein sequences derived from the reference
human genome differ from those in early publications.  Omicia has employed a
shifting algorithm to resolve discrepancies, whereby a best alignment is found
between the reference sequence and the data available directly from OMIM.  
If a single nucleotide change can represent an OMIM variant, then it is given
a score of 1.  Mutations are scored
by how well they overlap with data from other sources, for example dbSNP 
(overlap with an entry from dbSNP increases the score by +1, validation code
"d"), as well as additional data sources when available (increase the score 
by +1.5, validation code "c"), and whether they overlap with variants mapped
between OMIM and dbSNP by the NCBI (increase the score by +2, validation code
"D").  Mapped variants that require shifting have reduced scores based on the
quality of the shift, as assessed by the percentage of variants for a gene that
are mapped when shifted.  Shifted variants receive the validation code "s".
<LI>
Automated mapping and scoring of intron variants (e.g., IVS1AS, G-C, -1)
<P>
To map variants in and near introns, it is first necessary to determine the
exon and intron coordinates for each transcript, numbering the first exon as
exon 1, followed by intron 1.  All exons are counted, including those that
become untranslated regions.  Intron variants are scored based on the
information in the annotation.  If the acceptor or donor site is reported,
the variant receives a starting score of 1.5.  If the annotation does not
contain the AS/DS designation, then the variant is assumed to be relative to
the AS if the sign of the position is noted as positive (e.g., IVS3, G-A, +1),
and DS if the sign of the position is negative (IVS9, G-C, -1).  These
variants receive a starting score of 1.0.  Results are only reported and
scored if the nucleotide in the annotation matches the nucleotide determined
at the mapped position.  For the case of IVS1DS, T&gt;C, +2, if the +2 position
from the donor site were not T, then this variant would not be scored.
Intron variants that do not have the AS or DS designation in the OMIM
annotation receive a penalty score of 0.5, resulting in a total score
of 1.0.  The score is also reduced by 0.25 if the OMIM annotation
indicates that it is in the exon (e.g., IVS1AS, G-A, +3, validation code "o"),
and is increased by 0.5 if the position is greater than 2 nucleotides from
the splice site (validation code of "f").
<P>
In cases where there is more than one transcript of a gene, amino acid and
intron variants are mapped and scored for each transcript.
<LI>
Hand curation
<P>
Approximately 50 genes have been selected for hand curation of alleles.
Omicia selected these genes with the assistance of UCSC, and included 54 genes
frequently queried over a six month period spanning 2006-2007.  Additional 
genes were selected based on feedback from the community. The hand curation 
focused on confirming the accuracy of the computationally-mapped allelic 
variants and mapping the allelic
variants that could not be mapped by computational methods, including nucleotide
changes in non-coding regions, small deletions and insertions, and rearrangements.
