<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track indicates differences in genome assembly 
NCBI Build 36 (hg18) when compared to the next version GRCh37 
(hg19). Contigs used in this assembly, NCBI Build 36 (hg18), 
that were not carried forward to GRCh37 (hg19) are shown.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The contig coordinates were extracted from the AGP files for the assemblies.
Contigs that match the same name, same version, and the same specific
portion of sequence are noted as identical in the two
assemblies.  Contigs not satisifying those identical characteristics are
included in this track.
