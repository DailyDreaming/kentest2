<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
This super-track combines related tracks of genome-wide ChIP-chip
data generated by the Ludwig Institute/UC San Diego ENCODE group.
These tracks show TAF1 binding in fibroblastoid
(IMR90) cells as assayed by ChIP-chip using a NimbleGen microarray.  
<P>
TAF1, a protein found at the start of transcribed genes, is a general 
transcription factor that is a key part of the pre-initiation complex found 
on the promoter.  It is more fully known as TBP-associated factor 1 of the 
TFIID complex or by its molecular weight as TAF250.</P>
