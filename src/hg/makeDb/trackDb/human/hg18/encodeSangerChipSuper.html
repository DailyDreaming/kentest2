<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
This super-track combines related tracks of ChIP-chip data generated by
the ENCODE group at the Sanger Institute.
ChIP-chip, also known as genome-wide location analysis, is a technique for
isolation and identification of DNA sequences bound by specific proteins in
cells, including histones. Histone methylation and acetylation serves as a
stable genomic imprint
that regulates gene expression and other epigenetic
phenomena.  These histones are found in transcriptionally active domains
called euchromatin.</P>
<P>
These tracks contain ChIP-chip data for H3 and H4 histones
in multiple cell lines, including HeLa (cervical carcinoma), 
GM06990 (lymphoblastoid), K562 (myeloid leukemia), and
HFL-1 (embryonic lung fibroblast).
Experiments were conducted with
antibodies to histones with different post-translational modification marks.
Data are displayed as signals as well as hits and peak
centers identified by hidden Markov model (HMM) analysis.</P>
