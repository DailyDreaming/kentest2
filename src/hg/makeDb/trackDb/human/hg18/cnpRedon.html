<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>Experiments were performed with the International HapMap DNA and cell-line collection
using two technologies: comparative analysis of hybridization intensities on
Affymetric GeneChip Human Mapping 500K early access arrays (500K EA)
and comparative genomic hybridization with a Whole Genome TilePath (WGTP)
array.

<H2>Validation</H2>


The authors utilized numerous quality meaures, including
repeated experiments on the WGTP for 82 individual and on the 500K EA for 15 individuals.
The average false-positive rate per experiment was held beneath 5%.  Aberrant chromosomes were
removed from the analysis.    Further details are available in the Nature paper cited below.
