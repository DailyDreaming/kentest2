<H2>Description</H2>

<TABLE style='max-width: 900px'><TR><TD>
<P>This track shows probable binding sites of the specified transcription
factors (TFs) in the given cell types as determined by chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq).
Included for each cell type is the input signal, which represents the control
condition where no antibody targeting was performed.
For each experiment (cell type vs. antibody) this track shows
a graph of enrichment for TF binding (<I>Signal</I>), along with
sites that have the greatest evidence of transcription factor binding (<I>Peaks</I>).
<P>
The sequence reads, quality scores, and alignment coordinates from
these experiments are available for download.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<P>
This track is a multi-view composite track that contains multiple data types
(<EM>views</EM>).  For each view, there are multiple subtracks that
display individually on the browser.  Instructions for configuring multi-view
tracks are <A HREF="/goldenPath/help/multiView.html" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.
ENCODE tracks typically contain one or more of the following views:
<DL>
<DT><I>Peaks</I></DT><DD> Regions of signal enrichment based on processed data
(usually normalized data from pooled replicates). ENCODE Peaks tables contain
fields for statistical significance, including FDR
(<A HREF="/goldenPath/help/qValue.html" TARGET=_BLANK>qValue</A>).</DD>
<DT><I>Signal</I></DT><DD>Density graph (wiggle) of signal enrichment based on
processed data.</DD>
</DL>

<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>
Cells were grown according to the approved
<A HREF="/ENCODE/protocols/cell" TARGET=_BLANK>ENCODE cell culture protocols</A>.
Further preparations were similar to those previously published
(Euskirchen <EM>et al.</EM>, 2007) with the exceptions that the cells
were unstimulated and sodium orthovanadate was omitted from the buffers.
For details on the chromatin immunoprecipitation protocol used, see
Euskirchen <EM>et al.</EM> (2007) and Rozowsky <EM>et al.</EM> (2009).
</P>
<P>
DNA recovered from the precipitated chromatin was sequenced on the Illumina (Solexa)
sequencing platform and mapped to the genome using the Eland alignment program.
ChIP-seq data was scored based on sequence reads (length ~30 bps) that align uniquely
to the human genome. From the mapped tags a signal map of ChIP DNA fragments
(average fragment length ~ 200 bp) was constructed where the signal height is the number of
overlapping fragments at each nucleotide position in the genome.
</P>
<P>
For each 1 Mb segment of each chromosome a peak height threshold was
determined by requiring a false discovery rate &lt;= 0.05 when comparing the
number of peaks above threshold as compared the number obtained from multiple
simulations of a random null background with the same number of mapped
reads (also accounting for the fraction of mapable bases
for sequence tags in that 1 Mb segment). The number of mapped tags in a putative
binding region is compared to the normalized (normalized by correlating tag
counts
in genomic 10 kb windows) number of mapped tags in the same region from an input DNA control.
Using a binomial test, only regions that have a p-value &lt;= 0.05 are considered to be
significantly enriched compared to the input DNA control.

can be found in the

<H2>Release Notes</H2>

<P>
Update to Release 4 (Feb 2012): the GM12878/NFKB (IgG-rab) experiments and files have been revoked
because the incorrect raw data files were used for generation of the processed data.
</P>
<P>
This is Release 4 (June 2011) of this track, which includes 2 additional
experiments and 2 experiments, K562/NF-YA and K562/NF-YB that were present 
in earlier releases have been removed.
</P>
<P>
A number of previously released datasets have been replaced by updated versions.
The affected database tables and files include 'V3' 
in the name, and metadata is marked with "submittedDataVersion=V3",
followed by the specific reason. The specific reason is:
Includes previously missing sequence data.

Previous versions of files are available for download from the
<A HREF="ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg18/encodeDCC/wgEncodeYaleChIPseq/"
