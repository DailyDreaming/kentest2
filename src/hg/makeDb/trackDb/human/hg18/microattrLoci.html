<P>
This track displays the genes in the loci that are or have been involved in
microattribution reviews.  A microattribution review is a review article on
the variation found within a locus or a group of loci.  To participate in the
review article use the wiki to submit SNPs in or near a gene under review.  
You are then eligible to be a co-author on the review and will get credit for
the SNPs you submit (the microattribution).

review is complete, green is for active reviews, and blue is
