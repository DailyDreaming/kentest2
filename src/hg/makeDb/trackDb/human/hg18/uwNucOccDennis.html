<h1>Description</h1>

<p>
Inside the nucleus, DNA is wrapped into a complex molecular structure
called chromatin, whose fundamental unit is approximately 150 bp of DNA
organized around the eight-histone protein complex known as the
nucleosome.  This track contains predicted nucleosome occupancy scores
produced by a model that was trained using data from MDA-kb2 cell
line data from Dennis <i>et al.</i> (2007).  This cell line was
prepared with weak MNase digestion.  Hence, like the A375 model, the
Dennis model excels at recognizing regions that are frequently
occupied by a nucleosome.


<h1>Display Conventions and Configuration</h1>

<p>
The output of the SVM is a unitless discriminant score.  In the
browser, the score of a 50-mer is assigned to its 26th base.
Canonically, a score of 0 indicates an uncertain assignment; a score
of 1.0 corresponds to a confident prediction for being in the positive
class (i.e., a position of frequent nucleosome occupancy), and a score
of -1.0 corresponds to a confident prediction for being in the
negative class.</p>

<h1>Methods</h1>

<p>For a given microarray experiment, we identify the 1000 50 bp probes
with the highest log intensity ratios.  These comprise our positive
training samples.  In a similar fashion, we generate negative training
samples with the lowest log intensity ratios.  Each 50-mer in the
training set is converted into a 2772-element vector of k-mer
frequencies for <i>k</i>=1 up to 6 (collapsing reverse complements).
A linear SVM is then trained to discriminate between the two classes.
The SVM regularization parameter is selected by evaluating the entire
regularization path on a held-out portion of the training data set.
After training, each 50-mer in the human genome is converted to the
2772-element representation and scored using the trained SVM.</p>
