<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows alignments of full-length cDNAs that were used as the basis 
of the <A HREF="http://www.h-invitational.jp/hinv/ahg-db/index.jsp"
TARGET=_blank>H-Invitational Gene Database</A> (HInv-DB).  
The HInv-DB is a human gene database, with integrative annotation of 
56,419 full-length cDNA clones currently available from six high throughput
cDNA sequencing projects.  This database represents 25,585 cDNA clusters.
The project was initiated in 2002 and the database became publicly
available in April 2004.</P>
<P>
HInv-DB entries describe the following entities:
<UL>
<LI>gene structures
<LI>functions
<LI>novel alternative splicing isoforms
<LI>non-coding functional RNAs
<LI>functional domains
<LI>sub-cellular localizations
<LI>mapping of SNPs and microsatellite repeat motifs in relation with orphan 
diseases
<LI>gene expression profiling
<LI>comparative results with mouse full-length cDNAs in the context of
molecular evolution
</UL></P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
A full description of the construction of the HInv-DB is contained in the 
report by the H-Inv Consortium (see References section).</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
The H-InvDB is hosted at the JBIRC.
The human-curated annotations were produced during invitational annotation
meetings held in Japan during the summer of 2002, with a follow-up
meeting in November 2004.  Participants included 158 scientists 
representing 67 institutions from 12 countries.</P>
<P>
The full-length cDNA clones and sequences were produced by the
Chinese National Human Genome Center (CHGC), 
the Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ/MIPS), 
Helix Research Institute, Inc. (HRI), 
the Institute of Medical Science in the University of Tokyo (IMSUT), 
the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (KDRI), 
the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC/NIH) and the
Full-Length Long Japan (FLJ) project.</P>
