<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
These tracks display binding sites of specific transcription factors in
the ENCODE cell types, as identified by chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing.<br>
</p>
<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
These tracks are multi-view composite tracks that contains multiple
data types (views). For each view, there are multiple subtracks that
display individually on the browser.&nbsp; Each view within each track
has separate display controls, as described <a
href="/goldenPath/help/multiView.html">here</a>.
The views associated with these tracks include: <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Peaks</span>:
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Sites with the greatest evidence of
transcription factor binding.<br>
</div>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Raw Signal</span>: <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">A continuous signal which indicates
density of aligned reads.<br>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Credits<br>
</h2>
These data were generated and analyzed as part of the <a
 href="http://www.genome.gov/10005107">ENCODE</a> project, a
genome-wide consortium project with the aim of cataloging all
functional elements in the human genome.&nbsp; This effort includes
collecting a variety of data over a specific set of <a
href="/ENCODE/cellTypes.html">cell types</a>.&nbsp;
Consequently,
data related to these tracks be available under ENCODE
tracks. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>Data Release Policy</h2>
Data users may freely use ENCODE data, but may not, without prior
consent, submit publications that use an unpublished ENCODE dataset
until nine months following the release of the dataset. This date is
listed in the Restricted Until column on the track configuration page
and the download page. The full data release policy for ENCODE is
