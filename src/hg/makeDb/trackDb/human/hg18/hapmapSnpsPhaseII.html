<H2>Description</H2> 
<P> 
<A HREF="http://www.hapmap.org" TARGET=_blank>The HapMap Project</A>
identified a set of approximately four million
common SNPs, and genotyped these SNPs in four populations.
The intent is that this data can be used as a reference for future studies
of human disease. This track displays the genotype counts and allele
frequencies of those SNPs. The data displayed are from release 22 (HapMap 
Phase II), based on 
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/index.html" TARGET=_blank>dbSNP</A>
build 126.   This track also provides orthologous alleles from chimp and 
macaque.
</P>
<P>
The HapMap data are from these four human populations:
<UL>
<LI>Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI)</LI>
<LI>Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (JPT)</LI>
<LI>Han Chinese in Beijing, China (CHB)</LI>
<LI>CEPH (Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe) (CEU)</LI>
</UL>
Each of the populations is displayed in a separate subtrack.
</P>
<P>
The CEU and YRI data are comprised of 90 individuals in parent-child trios. The UCSC display
removes the data for the children, leaving 60 individuals in each population.
The CHB and JPT data are comprised of 45 individuals. 
</P>
<P>
The HapMap assays provide biallelic results. Over 99.9% of HapMap SNPs are
included in dbSNP build126 as biallelic; approximately 3,000 are more complex.
Two-thirds of the HapMap SNPs are transitions: one-third are A/G, one-third
are C/T.
</P>
<P>
The orthologous alleles in chimp (panTro2) and macaque (rheMac2) 
were derived using 
<A HREF="http://genome.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#Convert">liftOver</A>.
</P>
<P>
No two HapMap SNPs occupy the same position. Aside from seven SNPs from the 
pseudoautosomal region of chrX, no rsIds are included more than once. No HapMap SNPs
occur on chrM or on "random" chromosomes.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
<B>Note: calculation of heterozygosity has changed since this version of 
the track.</B>
In this track, <em>expected</em> heterozygosity is calculated 
as follows: the allele counts from all populations are summed 
(not normalized for population size)
and used to determine overall major and minor allele frequencies.  
Assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, overall expected heterozygosity
is calculated as two times the product of major and minor allele
frequencies 
(see <A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21425/box/A2510/"
TARGET=_BLANK><em>Modern Genetic Analysis</em>, section 17-2</A>).
[In the updated HapMap SNPs track,
<em>observed</em> heterozygosity is calculated as follows: each population's
heterozygosity is computed as the proportion of heterozygous individuals in 
the population.  The population heterozygosities are averaged to determine the 
overall observed heterozygosity.]
</P>
<P>
The human SNPs are displayed in gray using a color gradient based on minor allele
frequency. The higher the minor allele frequency, the darker the display. 
By definition, the maximum minor allele frequency is 50%. 
When zoomed to base level, the major allele is displayed for each population. 
</P>
<P>
Reversing the <A HREF="hgTrackUi?g=ruler">base position track</A> 
will cause the HapMap display to reverse as
well. This is the recommended configuration for SNPs on the negative strand.
</P>
<P>
The orthologous alleles from chimp and macaque are displayed in brown using a color 
gradient based on quality score.
Quality scores range from 0 to 100 representing low to high quality. For 
orthologous alleles, the higher the quality, the darker the display. Quality 
scores are not available for chimp chromosomes chr21 and chrY; these were set to
98, consistent with the panTro2 browser quality track.
</P>
<P>
Filters are provided for the data attributes described above. Additionally,
a filter is provided for heterozgosity over all populations. The measure of
heterozygosity used is 2pq (from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium). 
Filters are applied to all six subtracks.  This is true, even if a subtrack 
is not displayed.
<P>
Notes on orthologous allele filters:
<UL>
<LI>If the major allele is different between populations, no overall major
allele for human is determined, thus the &quot;matching&quot; filters for
orthologous alleles do not apply to these SNPs.</LI>
<LI>If a SNP is monomorphic in all populations, the minor allele is not
verified in the HapMap dataset.  In these cases, the filter to match
orthologous alleles to the minor human allele will yield no results.</LI>
</UL>
