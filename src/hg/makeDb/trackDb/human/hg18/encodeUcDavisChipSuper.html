<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
This super-track combines related tracks of ChIP-chip data generated by
the <A HREF="https://genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/" TARGET=_blank>Farnham 
laboratory</A> at the University of California, Davis.
ChIP-chip, also known as genome-wide location analysis, is a technique for
isolation and identification of DNA sequences bound by specific proteins in
cells.
</P>
<P>
These tracks contain ChIP-chip data for several transcription
factors, including E2F1 and PolII, in multiple cell lines
including HeLa (cervical carcinoma) and GM06990 (lymphoblastoid).
ChIP assays were performed using the protocol found at the
<A HREF="https://genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/"
TARGET=_blank>Farnham laboratory</A> web site.
Array hybridizations were performed using standard
<A HREF="https://sequencing.roche.com/en/products-solutions/by-category/target-enrichment/hybridization.html" TARGET=_blank>NimbleGen Systems</A>
conditions.
Data are displayed as signals and hits.
</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
These data were contributed by Mike Singer, Kyle Munn, Nan Jiang,
Todd Richmond and Roland Green of NimbleGen Systems, Inc.,
and Matt Oberley, David Inman, Mark Bieda, Shally Xu and Peggy Farnham
of the Farnham lab.</P>
