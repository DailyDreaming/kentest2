<H2>Description</H2>

<p>
This track shows regions
where transcription factors, proteins responsible for
modulating gene transcription, bind to DNA as assayed by ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies 
specific to the transcription factor followed by sequencing of the precipitated DNA).
Additional views of this dataset and additional documentation on the methods used
for this track are available at the
<A HREF=../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg18&g=wgEncodeYaleChIPseq>Yale TFBS Track</A> page. Some data in
this track are from the HAIB TFBS Track, which has been dropped from hg18.
The <i>Peaks
</i> views in those pages are the basis for the clusters shown here,  which combine data from
the peaks from the different cell lines and different transcription factors in those pages.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<p>
A gray box encompasses the peaks of transcription factor occupancy.  The darkness of the box 
is proportional to the maximum signal strength observed in any cell line.  The name to the left
of the box is the transcription factor. The letters to the right represent the cell lines where
a signal is detected.  The darkness of the letter is proportional to the signal strength in
the cell line. Click on an item in the track to see the cell lines spelled out.
