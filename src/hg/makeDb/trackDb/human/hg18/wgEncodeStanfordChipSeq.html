<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
ChIP-seq is a new approach for investigating entire transcription factor-DNA interactomes.
ChIP-seq is comprised of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by single-molecule-based
sequencing (seq).  ChIP-seq avoids the complications of array hybridization.
<P>
This track shows 25mer sequence reads obtained via a ChIP-seq protocol 
from samples enriched for a variety of transcription factors and a companion control sample
of the same fixed chromatin without immuno-enrichment.   These sequence
reads were later analyzed using a peak locator
to identify transcription factor positive binding events.
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
XXXX Fill out antibody methods.
<P>
Libraries were prepared from the ChIP DNA using the ligation mediated PCR Solexa protocol.  
The Solexa library construction protocol was modified to include a PCR preamplification following 
linker ligation and preceding gel electrophoresis.  Reducing the size and narrowing the
size range of DNAs collected from gel purification is intended to improve positional resolution of
ChIP-seq.

Reads which mapped to multiple genomic locations are not included.
Up to two mismatches were allowed.
