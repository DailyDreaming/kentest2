<P>
The Old UCSC Genes track shows genes from the previous version of
the UCSC Genes build.  This is similar to the current version but
without explicitly including CCDS proteins.  Additionally not as much 
data were available in Genbank, RefSeq, or UniProt for this older version.

<P>
Read the <A HREF="http:../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?c=chrX&g=knownGene">description</A> 
of how the current version of the UCSC Genes track was built.
