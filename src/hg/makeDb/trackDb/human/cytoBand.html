<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The chromosome band track represents the approximate 
location of bands seen on Giemsa-stained chromosomes.
Chromosomes are displayed in the browser with the short arm first.  
Cytologically identified bands on the chromosome are numbered outward 
from the centromere on the short (p) and long (q) arms.  At low resolution, 
bands are classified using the nomenclature 
[<em>chromosome</em>][<em>arm</em>][<em>band</em>], where <em>band</em> is a 
single digit. Examples of bands on chromosome 3 include 3p2, 3p1, cen, 3q1, 
and 3q2.  At a finer resolution, some of the bands are subdivided into 
sub-bands, adding a second digit to the <em>band</em> number, e.g. 3p26. This 
resolution produces about 500 bands. A final subdivision into a 
total of 862 sub-bands is made by adding a period and another digit to the 
<em>band</em>, resulting in 3p26.3, 3p26.2, etc. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
A full description of the method by which the chromosome band locations are 
estimated can be found in Furey and Haussler, 2003.
<P>
Barbara Trask, Vivian Cheung, Norma Nowak and others in the BAC Resource
Consortium used fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) to determine a 
cytogenetic location for large genomic clones on the chromosomes.
The results from these experiments are the primary source of information used
in estimating the chromosome band locations.
For more information about the process, see the paper, Cheung,
<EM>et al.</EM>, 2001.  and the accompanying web site,

<P>
BAC clone placements in the human sequence are determined at UCSC using a 
combination of full BAC clone sequence, BAC end sequence, and STS marker 
information.</P>
