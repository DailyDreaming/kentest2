<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows alternate sequence indicated by the
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/"
target="_blank">GRC</a> (Genome Reference Consortium) to the GRCh37 (hg19)
reference sequence in an effort to provide the best possible reference
assembly for the human genome. The GRC does this by both generating multiple
representations (haplotypes/alternate loci) for regions that are too complex
to be represented by a single path and by releasing regional fixes to short
sections of DNA known as patches. This allows users who are interested in a
specific locus to get an improved representation without affecting users who
need chromosome coordinate stability.

<h3><font color="#0000FF">Haplotypes</font></h3>

<p>
Items in the <em>Haplotype</em> track show sequence variation present in the
population for certain sections of the genome. Items in this track were either
designated as alternate loci or novel patches by the GRC. To view the alternate
sequence, click on the &quot;Fetch alternate sequence&quot; link that appears on the sequence
details pages. Data points in this track are always displayed in
<font color="#0000FF"><b>blue</b></font>.
</p>

<h3><font color="#FF0000">Patches</font></h3>

<p>
Items in the <em>Patch</em> track indicate areas of the sequence that have
been corrected by the GRC and will be updated to new sequence in the next full
human assembly release. To view the new, corrected sequence, click on the
&quot;Fetch alternate sequence&quot; link that appears on the sequence
details pages. Data points in this track are always displayed in
<font color="#FF0000"><b>red</b></font>.
</p>

<h3>Alignment</h3>

<p>
The <em>Alignment</em> track is the PSL representation of the <em>Chain</em>
track.  This PSL representation allows the side-by-side alignment to be
viewed.  It was created from the Chain track data using
the <em>chainToPsl</em> kent source utility. This track follows the display
conventions for
<a href="/goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#PSLDisplay" target="_blank">
PSL alignment tracks</a>. Alignments are displayed in <b>black</b> and,
depending on the track configuration settings, may be interspersed with
vertical <font color="#F88017"><b>orange</b></font> lines.
</p>

<h3>Chain Track</h3>

<p>
The chain track shows the alignment of human genome alternate sequence to the
human $date genome sequence using a gap scoring system that allows
longer gaps than traditional affine gap scoring systems. It can also
tolerate gaps in both human and the alternate sequence simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
The chain track displays boxes joined together by either single or
double lines. The boxes represent aligning regions.
Single lines indicate gaps that are largely due to a deletion in the
human assembly or an insertion in the alternate sequence.
Double lines represent more complex gaps that involve substantial
sequence in both sequences.
</p>

<p>
In the "pack" and "full" display
modes, the individual feature names indicate the chromosome, strand, and
location (in thousands) of the match for each matching alignment.
By default, the chains to chromosome-based assemblies are colored
based on which chromosome they map to in the aligning organism. To turn
off the coloring, check the &quot;off&quot; button next to: Color
track based on chromosome (click "Chains" text in controls to view options).
</p>

<p>
To display only the chains of one chromosome in the aligning
sequence, enter the name of that chromosome (e.g., chr4) in box next to:
Filter by chromosome (click "Chains" text in controls to view options).
</p>

<p>
Data points in this track are displayed according to the chromosome color key
that appears just below the Browser display (e.g., data points on
chromosome 21 appear in <font color="#DD88FD"><b>this color</b></font>).
</p>

<h3>Net Track</h3>

<p>
The net track shows the best human/alternate chain for every part of the alternate
sequence. It is useful for finding orthologous regions and for studying genome
rearrangement. The human sequence used in this annotation is from the $date assembly.
</p>

<p>
In full display mode, the top-level (level 1) chains are the largest, highest-scoring
chains that span this region. In many cases, gaps exist in the top-level chain. When
possible, these are filled in by other chains that are displayed at level 2. The gaps in
level 2 chains may be filled by level 3 chains and so forth.
</p>

<p>
In the graphical display, the boxes represent ungapped alignments; the lines represent
gaps. Click on a box to view detailed information about the chain as a whole; click on a
line to display information about the gap.  The detailed information is useful in determining
the cause of the gap or, for lower level chains, the genomic rearrangement.
</p>

<p>
Individual items in the display are categorized as one of four types (other than gap):
</p>

<p><ul>
<li><b>Top</b> - The best, longest match. Displayed on level 1.</li>
<li><b>Syn</b> - Line-ups on the same chromosome as the gap in the level above it.</li>
<li><b>Inv</b> - A line-up on the same chromosome as the gap above it, but in the opposite orientation.</li>
<li><b>NonSyn</b> - A match to a chromosome different from the gap in the level above.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>
Data points in this track are displayed according to the chromosome color key
that appears just below the Browser display (e.g., data points on
chromosome 21 appear in <font color="#DD88FD"><b>this color</b></font>).
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<h3>Haplotype/Patch Tracks</h3>

<p>
The locations of the Patches and Haplotypes were established by NCBI and specified in the files at:<br>
<a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/Eukaryotes/vertebrates_mammals/Homo_sapiens/GRCh37/"
target="_blank">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/Eukaryotes/vertebrates_mammals/Homo_sapiens/GRCh37/</a>ALT_REF_LOCI_*/placed_scaffolds/alt_locus_scaf*primary.pos
</p>

<p>
and the patch release site:<br>
<a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/Eukaryotes/vertebrates_mammals/Homo_sapiens/"
target="_blank">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/Eukaryotes/vertebrates_mammals/Homo_sapiens/</a>GRCh37.p*/PATCHES/alt_scaffolds/alt_scaffold_placement.txt
</p>

<h3>Chain Track</h3>

<p>
The lastz alignments between the human sequence and the alternate sequence were restricted to
only the region that the haplotype overlaps the human sequence or the region of the human
sequence that is replaced by the updated patch sequence. The resulting alignments were converted
into axt format using the lavToAxt program. The axt alignments were fed into axtChain, which
organizes all alignments between the single human region of the alignment and a single region from
the alternate sequence into a group and creates a kd-tree out of the gapless subsections (blocks)
of the alignments. A dynamic program was then run over the kd-trees to find the maximally scoring
chains of these blocks.

$matrix
</p>

<p>
Chains scoring below a minimum score of '$chainMinScore' were discarded; the remaining chains are
displayed in this track.  The linear gap matrix used with axtChain:<br>
$chainLinearGap
</p>

<h3>Net Track</h3>

<p>
Chains were derived from lastz alignments, using the methods described in the chain track description
above, and sorted with the highest-scoring chains in the genome ranked first. The program chainNet was
then used to place the chains one at a time, trimming them as necessary to fit into sections not already
covered by a higher-scoring chain. During this process, a natural hierarchy emerged in which a chain that
filled a gap in a higher-scoring chain was placed underneath that chain. The program netSyntenic was used
to fill in information about the relationship between higher- and lower-level chains, such as whether a
lower-level chain was syntenic or inverted relative to the higher-level chain. The program netClass was then
used to fill in how much of the gaps and chains contained <em>N</em>s (sequencing gaps) in one or both species
and how much was filled with transposons inserted before and after the two sequences diverged.
