<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays transcriptome data from tiling GeneChips produced by 
<A HREF="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/microarray-analysis.html" TARGET="_blank">Affymetrix</A>. For the
complete non-repetitive portion of the human genome, more than 256 million
probe pairs were tiled every 5 bp in non-repeat-masked areas and hybridized to
cytosolic polyA+ long RNA (&gt;200 nucleotides) from 8 different cell lines.
Note that the female cell lines HeLa, SK-N-AS, and U87MG do not contain data 
for chrY. For the HeLa and HepG2 cell types, samples were also produced for 
nuclear RNA in addition to cytosolic polyA+ RNA. For experimental details and 
results, see Kapranov <em>et al</em>.  in the References section below. </P>
<P>
This track shows the coordinates of transcribed fragments (transfrags) 
representing long RNAs.  A separate track -- &quot;Affy Tx lRNA Sig&quot; -- 
contains signals (PM-MM values) for each probe pair plotted against its genomic 
coordinates (see Kapranov <em>et al</em>. in the References section below). </P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This annotation follows the display conventions for composite tracks. The
subtracks within this annotation may be configured in a variety of ways to
highlight different aspects of the displayed data. The graphical configuration
options are shown at the top of the track description page, followed by a list
of subtracks. For more information about the graphical configuration options,
click the 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgWiggleTrackHelp.html">Graph
configuration help</A> link. To display only selected subtracks, uncheck the
boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide. 

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
For each data point, probes within 30 bp on either side were used to improve
the estimate of expression level for a particular probe. This helped to smooth
the data and produce a more robust estimate of the transcription level at a
particular genomic location. The following analysis steps were used: </P>
<OL>
<LI>
Replicate arrays were quantile-normalized and the median intensity (using 
both PM and MM intensities) of each array was scaled to a target value of 50. 
<LI>
The expression level was estimated for each mapped probe position by 
collecting all the probe pairs that fell within a window of ± 30 bp,
calculating all non-redundant pairwise averages of PM - MM values
of all probe pairs in the window, and taking the median of all resulting 
pairwise averages.
<LI>
The resulting signal value is the Hodges-Lehmann estimator associated with 
the Wilcoxon signed-rank statistic of the PM - MM values that lie within ± 30 
bp of the sliding window centered at every genomic coordinate. These data are
displayed in the track &quot;Affy Tx lRNA Sig&quot;.
<LI>
Transfrags were determined by connecting adjacent positive probes with a 
maximum allowable gap of 11 nucleotides and a minimum 
run of 49 nucleotides (at least 11 probes with at most one negative probe 
between two positive probes). Transfrags were discarded if they overlapped 
pseudogenes or harbored low-complexity or repetitive sequences.
