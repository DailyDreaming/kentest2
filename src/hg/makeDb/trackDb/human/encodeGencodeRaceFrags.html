<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
RACEfrags are the products of 5&#8217; RACE reactions performed on GENCODE 
genes (using the primers displayed in the subtrack "Gencode 5&#8217; 
RACE primer") in 12 tissues and 3 cell lines (15 subtracks) followed 
by hybridization on ENCODE tiling arrays. Each RACEfrag is linked to the 
5&#8217; RACE primer but no other connectivity information is available 
from this experiment.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
For a detailed description of the methods and references used, see 
Denoeud <em>et al</em>., 2007. </P>
<P>
A combination of 5&#8217; RACE and 
high-density tiling microarrays were used to empirically annotate 5&#8217; 
transcription start sites (TSSs) and internal exons of all 410 annotated
protein-coding loci across the 44 ENCODE regions (Oct. 2005 GENCODE
freeze ; Harrow <em>et al</em>., 2006). Oligonucleotides for 5&#8217; RACE 
experiments were chosen such that they map to a coding exon (the index exon) 
common to most of the transcripts of protein-coding gene loci annotated by 
the GENCODE (Oct. 2005 freeze).  The 5&#8217; RACE reactions were 
performed with oligonucleotides mapping to a coding exon (the index exon) 
on polyA+ RNA from twelve adult human tissues (brain, heart, kidney, spleen, 
liver, colon, small intestine, muscle, lung, stomach, testis, placenta) and 
three cell lines

TARGET=_blank>HeLaS3</A> (cervix carcinoma)).</P>

The RACE reactions were then hybridized to 20 nucleotide-resolution 
Affymetrix tiling arrays covering the non-repeated regions of the 44 ENCODE 
regions. The resulting &quot;RACEfrags&quot; -- array-detected fragments of 
RACE products -- were assessed for novelty by comparing their genomic
coordinates to those of GENCODE-annotated exons. 

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Connectivity between novel RACEfrags and their respective index exon were 
investigated by RT-PCR using the 5&#8217; RACE primer as one of the primers, 
followed by hybridization on tiling arrays. 385 RT-PCR reactions corresponding 
to 199 GENCODE loci were positive after hybridization on tiling arrays 
(244 RACE reactions).  All positive RT-PCR reactions and a subset of those 
that were negative in the hybridization experiments were further verified by 
cloning and sequencing of the RT-PCR products. In most cases, eight clones were 
selected from each set of RT-PCR products for sequencing. To be retained in 
the dataset, these sequences must unambiguously map to the 
correct location, show splicing and pass manual inspection by the 
HAVANA team. By these criteria, 89 of these RT-PCR 
reactions (69 GENCODE loci) were positive after cloning and sequencing.
(see Denoeud <em>et al</em>., 2007 for further details). 
The resulting cDNA sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession 
numbers DQ655905-DQ656069 and EF070113-EF070122. See additional information 
about the sequences
