<P>
  <EM><B>Note: The original version of this track contained incorrect allele
    frequencies for approximately 1% of all variants in dbSNP build 142;
    specifically, variants submitted by the 1000 Genomes Project and mapped to
    the reverse (-) strand of the genome.
    In November 2015, we released an update that removed the incorrect allele
    frequency data so the affected variants now have no allele frequency data.
