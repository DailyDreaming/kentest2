<P>
This track displays <B>
in vitro Footprinting
</B> data for the NHGRI ENCODE target regions.  This is technique by
which one identifies an occupied protein binding site, in DNA that has
been extracted from cells. The presence of a bound protein prevents
the enzyme DNase I from "nicking" a protected region, which can be
detected by an appropriately designed gel.

The long-term goal of the NHGRI <A
HREF="http://www.genome.gov/10005107" TARGET=_BLANK>ENCODE Project
(ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements)</A> is to identify all functional
elements in the human genome sequence to facilitate a better
understanding of human biology and disease.

<P>
During the pilot phase, 44 regions comprising 30 Mb -- approximately
1% of the human genome -- have been selected for intensive study to
identify, locate and analyze functional elements within the
regions. These targets are being studied by a diverse public research
consortium to test and evaluate the efficacy of various methods,
technologies, and strategies for locating genomic features. The
outcome of this initial phase will form the basis for a larger-scale
effort to analyze the entire human genome.

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.genome.gov/10506161" TARGET=_BLANK>The ENCODE
Project: Target Selection Process</A> provides a description of how
the initial target regions were selected.
