<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows rare variants associated with monogenic congenital defects of immunity to 
the <b>SARS-CoV-2</b> virus identified by the 
<a target=_blank href="https://www.covidhge.com/">COVID Human Genetic Effort</a>. 
This international consortium aims to discover truly causative variations: those underlying 
severe forms of COVID-19 in previously healthy individuals, and those that make certain 
individuals resistant to infection by the SARS-CoV2 virus despite repeated exposure.
</p>
<p>
The major feature of the small set of  variants in this track is that they are functionally tested
to be <b>deleterious</b> and genetically tested to be <b>disease-causing</b>. 
Specifically, rare variants were predicted to be loss-of-function at human loci known to govern
interferon (IFN) immunity to influenza virus in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia, 
relative to subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection.
These genetic defects display incomplete penetrance for influenza respiratory distress and only
appear clinically upon infection with the more virulent SARS-CoV-2.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
This track uses variant calls in autosomal IFN-related genes from whole exome and genome data 
with a MAF lower than 0.001 (gnomAD v2.1.1) and experimental demonstration of loss-of-function.
The patient population studied consisted of 659 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia 
relative to 534 subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection of varying ethnicities. 
Variants underlying autosomal-recessive or autosomal-dominant deficiencies were identified in 
23 patients (3.5%) 17 to 77 years of age.
The proportion of individuals carrying at least one variant was compared between severe cases 
and control cases by means of logistic regression with the likelihood ratio test.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted with Plink v1.9 software on whole exome and 
genome sequencing data with the 1000 Genomes (1kG) Project phase 3 public database as reference.
Analysis of enrichment in rare synonymous variants of the genes was performed to check the 
calibration of the burden test. 
The odds ratio was also estimated by logistic regression and adjusted for ethnic heterogeneity.
