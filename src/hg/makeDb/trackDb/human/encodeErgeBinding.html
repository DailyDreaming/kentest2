This track displays <B>
DNA Binding
</B> data for the NHGRI ENCODE target regions.  This experimet is
known by many names: gel shift assay, gel mobility shift assay (GMSA),
band shift assay (BSA), and electrophoretic mobility shift assay
(EMSA)). It is a method by which one can determine whether a particular
protein preparation contains factors which bind to a particular DNA
fragment. When a radiolabeled DNA fragment is run on a gel, it shows a
characteristic mobility. If it is first incubated with a cellular
extract of proteins (or with purified protein), any protein-DNA
complexes will migrate slower than the naked DNA, resulting in a
shifted band.

The long-term goal of the NHGRI <A
HREF="http://www.genome.gov/10005107" TARGET=_BLANK>ENCODE Project
(ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements)</A> is to identify all functional
elements in the human genome sequence to facilitate a better
understanding of human biology and disease.

<P>
During the pilot phase, 44 regions comprising 30 Mb -- approximately
1% of the human genome -- have been selected for intensive study to
identify, locate and analyze functional elements within the
regions. These targets are being studied by a diverse public research
consortium to test and evaluate the efficacy of various methods,
technologies, and strategies for locating genomic features. The
outcome of this initial phase will form the basis for a larger-scale
effort to analyze the entire human genome.

Project: Target Selection Process</A> provides a description of how
the initial target regions were selected.
