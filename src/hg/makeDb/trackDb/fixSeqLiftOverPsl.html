<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows alignments of fix patch sequences to
main chromosome sequences in the reference genome assembly.
When errors are corrected in the reference genome assembly, the
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc" target=_blank>Genome Reference Consortium
(GRC)</a> adds fix patch sequences containing the corrected regions.
This strikes a balance between providing the most complete and correct genome
sequence, while maintaining stable chromosome coordinates for the original assembly
sequences.
</p>
<p>
Fix patches are often associated with incident reports displayed in the GRC Incidents
track.

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
This track follows the display conventions for
<a href="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#PSLDisplay" target="_blank">
PSL alignment tracks</a>.
Mismatching bases are highlighted in red.
Several types of alignment gap may also be colored;
for more information, see
<a href="../goldenPath/help/hgIndelDisplay.html" target="_blank">
Alignment Insertion/Deletion Display Options</a>.
</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>
The alignments were provided by NCBI as GFF files and translated into the PSL
representation for browser display by UCSC.
