<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows Genoscope gene model annotations from the 
<A HREF="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/gaze" TARGET=_blank>GAZE</A> program written by
Kevin Howe. These annotations were computed using GAZE with a custom designed gene model. GAZE
integrates information from Geneid, Genscan, Exofish (Human, Mouse and Fugu), Genewise (Human and
Mouse) and Tetraodon cDNAs.

GAZE was run on masked Tetraodon genomic DNA using parameters calibrated for 
the Tetraodon genome.
