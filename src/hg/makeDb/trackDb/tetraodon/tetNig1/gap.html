<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.  These gaps - with the
exception of intractable centromeric gaps - will be closed during the
finishing process. 
</P><P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is known, it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gaps. In this assembly, 
<em>ultracontig</em> refers to an assembly of supercontigs (scaffolds).
</P>
<P>This assembly contains the following principal types of gaps:
<UL>
<LI><B>Fragment</B> - gaps between the ordered-and-oriented scaffolds 
(supercontigs) inside an ultracontig (1,000 <I>N</I>s).
In this context, a contig is a set of overlapping sequence reads.
<LI><B>Contig</B> - gaps between ultracontigs
<UL>
<LI><em>bridged</em> - the scaffolds within the ultracontigs are ordered and 
oriented (50,000 <I>N</I>s).
<LI><em>unbridged</em> - the scaffolds and ultracontigs are assigned to a 
chromosome but are not ordered/oriented (chrN_random) or are not assigned to a 
chromsome (chrUn_random) (2,000 <I>N</I>s). 
</UL>
<LI><B>Centromere</B> - gaps from centromeres (500,000 <I>N</I>s).  
</UL></P>
