<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows the <I>Tetraodon nigroviridis</I> V7 assembly provided by
<A HREF="https://www.genoscope.cns.fr/externe/tetraodon/"
TARGET=_blank>Genoscope</A>, Evry, France. 
The assembly has a sequence coverage of about 7.9X and contains 25,773 
scaffolds (supercontigs) and covers >90% of the genome which is estimated to
be 385 million base pairs.
</P>
<P>In dense mode, this track depicts the path through the draft (aka the golden path) used to create the assembled sequence.  Clone boundaries are 
distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown coloration. Where gaps
exist in the path, spaces are shown between the gold and brown blocks.  If the 
relative order and orientation of the supercontigs between the two blocks is 
known, a line is drawn to bridge the blocks.</P>
<P>
The Genome Browser depicts the Tetraodon genome as 21 chromosomes, 5 random 
chromosomes in which scaffolds and ultracontigs are not ordered/oriented, and 1 
chromosome of unmapped scaffolds and ultracontigs (chrUn_random).
<P>
All components within this track are of fragment type &quot;W&quot;
(WGS supercontig).
</P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The V7 Tetraodon genome was sequenced using the whole genome shotgun (WGS) 
approach and assembled with the Arachne assembler. Contigs (45,609; 
N50 length = 16 kb) were assembled into supercontigs (25,773; 
N50 length = 731 kb). The supercontigs were then combined into ultracontigs (128; 
N50 length = 1,382 kb) with the use of mapping data and synteny information. 39 
of these ultracontigs were mapped to chromosomes.

<P>
The Tetraodon WGS project may be found in GenBank as accession number 
CAAE00000000, consisting of sequences CAAE01000001-CAAE01025773.

The Tetraodon V7 release of the genome sequence was produced by a collaboration 
between Genoscope and the Center for Genome Research at the 
Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.
