<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.  These gaps - with the
exception of intractable heterochromatic gaps - may be closed during the
finishing process in future assemblies. 
</P><P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is known, it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap. 
</P>
<P>This assembly contains two types of gaps:
<UL>
<LI><B>Fragment</B> - Gaps that are covered by read pairs. The 
  approximate gap size is known and varies in length.
<LI><B>Contig</B> - Gaps between unordered and/or unoriented contigs.
  The gap size is not known and is set to a default of 250 bases 
  for chrU and to a default of 1000 bases for all other chromosomes.
