<P>
This track shows the draft assembly of the $organism genome.  
</P>
<P>In dense mode, this track depicts the path through the contigs 
(aka the golden path) used to create the assembled sequence. 
Contig boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Where gaps
exist in the path, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  If a gap between two blocks (contigs) is covered by 
a read pair, then a line is drawn to bridge the blocks.</P>

The Release 1.0 <em>D. simulans</em> assembly, produced by the 
<A HREF="https://www.genome.wustl.edu/" 
TARGET=_blank>Genome Sequencing Center</A> at the Washington University 
(WUSTL) School of Medicine in St. Louis, represents a mosaic of
several different <em>D. simulans</em> lines. The assembly process
began with an ~4X Whole Genome Shotgun assembly of the the <em>D. simulans</em>
w501 line.  The w501 contigs were initially anchored, ordered and
oriented by alignment with the <em>D. melanogaster</em> genome. The assembly
was then examined for places where the w501 assembly suggested
inversions with respect to the melanogaster assembly. One major
inversion was found, confirming the already documented inversion found
by 
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5729"
TARGET=_BLANK>Lemeunier and Ashburner (1976)</A>.  Six other
<em>D. simulans</em> lines (c167.4, md106ts, md199s, nc48s, sim4, and sim6)
were assembled with ~1X coverage.  Using the 4X WGS assembly of the
simulans w501 genome as a scaffold, contigs and unplaced reads from
the 1X assemblies of the other individual <em>D. simulans</em> lines were used
to cover gaps in the w501 assembly where possible.  Thus the resulting
assembly is a mosaic containing the w501 contigs as the primary
scaffolding with contigs and unplaced reads from the other lines
filling gaps in the w501 assembly.
