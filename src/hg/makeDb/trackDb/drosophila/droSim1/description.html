<H3>Sample position queries</H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of an
mRNA or EST, a chromosomal range, or keywords
from the GenBank description of an mRNA. The following list provides
examples of valid position queries for the Drosophila
genome. Note that some position queries (e.g. &quot;huntington&quot;) may return
matches to the mRNA records of other species. In these cases, the
mRNAs are mapped to their homologs in Drosophila.  See the 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html" TARGET=_blank>
User's Guide</A> for more information.

<H3>Assembly details</H3>
<P>
The Release 1.0 <em>D. simulans</em> assembly represents a mosaic of
several different <em>D. simulans</em> lines. The assembly process
began with an ~4X WGS assembly of the the <em>D. simulans</em> w501 line.  
The w501 contigs were initially anchored, ordered and oriented by
alignment with the <em>D. melanogaster</em> genome. The assembly was then
examined for places where the w501 assembly suggested inversions with
respect to the <em>D. melanogaster</em> assembly. One major inversion was 
found, confirming the already documented inversion found by 
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5729"
TARGET=_BLANK>Lemeunier and Ashburner</A> (1976).  Six other
<em>D. simulans</em> lines (c167.4, md106ts, md199s, nc48s, sim4, and sim6)
were assembled with ~1X coverage.  Using the 4X WGS assembly of the
simulans w501 genome as a scaffold, contigs and unplaced reads from
the 1X assemblies of the other individual <em>D. simulans</em> lines were used
to cover gaps in the w501 assembly where possible.  Thus the resulting
assembly is a mosaic containing the w501 contigs as the primary
scaffolding, with contigs and unplaced reads from the other lines
filling gaps in the w501 assembly.</P>
<P>
Mitochondrial sequence was
downloaded separately from GenBank.  Total size, excluding the gapless
14,972 bp mitochondrial sequence, is 142,405,747 bp including gaps and
127,241,461 bp excluding gaps. </P>
<P>
The sequence is distributed among the following chromosomes: 2L, 2R,
2h (random only), 3L, 3R, 3h (random only), 4, X, Xh (random only), Yh
(random only), M (mitochondria) and U.
Sequence that could not be reliably ordered within a chromosome
<em>N</em> has been placed on chr<em>N</em>_random. Heterochromatin
that has been localized to a specific chromosome can be found in
chr<em>N</em>h_random.  For more information about the
<em>D. simulans</em> assembly and statistics, see the WUSTL Genome
