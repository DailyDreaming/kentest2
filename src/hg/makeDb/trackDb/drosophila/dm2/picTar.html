<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows microRNA target sites in 3' UTRs as predicted by PicTar,
based on the full-length cDNAs provided by FlyBase.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The original PicTar algorithm was published in Krek <em>et al.</em>,
2005. The annotations displayed in this track are updated predictions as 
published in Lall <em>et al.</em>, 2006.
<P>
PicTar is a hidden Markov model
that assigns probabilities to 3' UTR subsequences as a binding site for a
microRNA, considers all possible ways the 3' UTR could be bound by microRNAs,
and then uses a maximum likelihood method to compute the optimal likelihood
under which the 3' UTR could be explained by microRNAs and background.
The score is this likelihood divided by background, <EM>i.e.</EM>, the local
base composition of each 3' UTR is taken into account. To fit the
track conventions of the UCSC browser (integers), all scores were scaled by
the maximum score of all microRNA 3'-UTR scores observed. Note that the PicTar
algorithm
scores any 3' UTR that has at least one aligned conserved predicted binding
site for a microRNA, but then incorporates all possible binding sites into
the score, even if they appear to be non-conserved. Because the score for
a 3' UTR is a &quot;phylo&quot; average over all orthologous 3' UTRs used,
&quot;scattered&quot;
sites that appear in many species may boost the score, and individual sites
shown in the display may not be aligned and conserved in all species under
consideration. </P>
<P>
Two levels of conservation can be chosen: <BR>
-- conservation among four <em>Drosophila</em> species:
<em>melanogaster</em>, <em>yakuba</em>, <em>ananassae</em>, and 
<em>pseudoobscura</em> (high sensitivity settings) <BR>
-- conservation among six <em>Drosophila</em> species: 
<em>melanogaster</em>, <em>yakuba</em>, <em>ananassae</em>, 
<em>pseudoobscura</em>, <em>mojavensis</em>, and <em>virilis</em>
</P>
<P>
The latter settings have improved quality, but lower sensitivity.</P>
