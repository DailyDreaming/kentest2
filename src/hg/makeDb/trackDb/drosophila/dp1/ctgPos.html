This track shows the locations of scaffolds in chrUn.  
chrUn is our concatenation of all scaffolds into an imaginary chromosome.  
The <em>D. pseudoobscura</em> scaffolds have not yet been ordered 
and oriented onto chromosomes, but our genome browser requires 
chromosome coordinates, hence the chrUn.
