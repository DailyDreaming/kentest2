<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The All-Drosophila RefSeq Genes track shows known protein-coding genes 
for all Drosophila species taken from the NCBI mRNA reference sequences 
collection (RefSeq). </P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track follows the display conventions for 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay">gene prediction 
tracks</A>.
The color shading indicates the level of review the RefSeq record has 
undergone: predicted (light), provisional (medium), reviewed (dark). </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Refseq mRNAs for all Drosophila species were aligned against the genome 
using blat in translated mode. When a single mRNA aligned in multiple places, 
only the best alignments that had at least 25% sequence identity 
and covered at least 30% of the mRNA were kept. </P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
This track was produced at UCSC from mRNA
sequence data generated by scientists worldwide and curated by the
NCBI <A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/" TARGET=_blank>RefSeq
project</A>.</P>
