<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows <em>D. melanogaster</em> protein-coding genes annotated by the 
<A HREF="http://www.fruitfly.org/" TARGET=_BLANK>
Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project</A> (BDGP).  
The gene locations have been mapped onto the <em>D. pseudoobscura</em> 
sequence using chained whole-genome 
<em>D. pseudoobscura</em>/<em>D. melanogaster</em> 
blastz alignments.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
For a description of the methods used to generate the data shown in this track,

<P>
The genomes of <em>D. pseudoobscura</em> and <em>D. melanogaster</em> 
are aligned with 
<A HREF="http://bio.cse.psu.edu/dist/blastz.pdf" TARGET=_blank>blastz</A>.  
The resulting alignments are converted into axt format
and the resulting axts are fed into <em>axtChain</em>.  AxtChain organizes all 
the alignments between a single <em>D. pseudoobscura</em> scaffold and a single 
<em>D. melanogaster</em> chromosome into a group, and makes a kd-tree out of 
all the gapless subsections
(blocks) of the alignments.  Next, maximally scoring chains of these
blocks are found by running a dynamic program over the kd-tree.  Chains
scoring below a threshold are discarded, and the remaining chains are
used by the <em>liftOver</em> program to translate <em>D. melanogaster</em> 
coordinates into <em>D. pseudoobscura</em> coordinates for display in 
this track.  Because of the evolutionary distance between the two species 
and the incomplete sequence of <em>D. pseudoobscura</em>, liftOver was 
run with relaxed constraints (minimum 50% matching bases, minimum 50% 
mapping of aligned blocks/exons, tolerate missing start/end of CDS).
