<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows RNA expression of protein coding and noncoding sequences 
at each major life cycle stage, 
as described in Stolc et al. (2004)

<P>
Six life cycle stages (early embryo, late embryo, larva, pupa, adult male 
and adult female) were hybridized four times each to DNA oligonucleotide 
microarrays with unique probe sequences tiled throughout the genome and 
across predicted splice junctions. 
</P>
<P>
Three sets of probes can be viewed in this track:
<UL>
<LI><B>All Probes:</B> 179,973 exonic, non-exonic and splice junction probes
    (all probes except for negative control probes).</LI>
<LI><B>Probes Expressed Above Background:</B> 92,136 exonic, non-exonic 
    and splice juntion probes determined to 
    have significant expression (see the Bussemaker lab's 
    <A HREF="http://bussemaker.bio.columbia.edu/papers/Science2004/peab_discussion.html" TARGET=_BLANK>discussion</A> of methods).
</LI>
<LI><B>Probes Differentially Expressed by ANOVA:</B> 33,965 exonic 
    and non-exonic probes (no splice junction probes) determined to 
    be differentially expressed at a false discovery rate of 5% as 
    discussed in the publication. </LI>
</UL>
By default, only the Probes Expressed Above Background set is visible.  
To enable/disable the probe sets, click on the track control button 
(blue or gray rectangle to the left of the track in the image) or the 
track control link (the short name of the track, "FEEP" in the 
Expression and Regulation group in the track 
controls section below the image).  
</P>
<P>
In full, packed and squished display modes, medians of all experiments 
for each stage are shown. 
Dense display mode shows the placement of the probe sequences.
