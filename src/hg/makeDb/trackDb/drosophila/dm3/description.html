<H3>Sample position queries</H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of an
mRNA or EST, a chromosomal range, an Ensembl transcript ID, or keywords
from the GenBank description of an mRNA. The following list provides
examples of valid position queries for the Drosophila
genome. Note that some position queries (e.g. &quot;huntington&quot;) may return
matches to the mRNA records of other species. In these cases, the
mRNAs are mapped to their homologs in Drosophila.  See the 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html" TARGET=_blank>
User's Guide</A> for more information.

<H3>Assembly details</H3>
<P>
The Release 5 <em>D. melanogaster</em> assembly combines euchromatic and 
heterochromatic sequence.  
</P>
<P>
The six euchromatic arms (chr2L, chr2R, chr3L, chr3R, chr4, chrX) 
were sequenced and assembled by BDGP from a combination of BAC and whole genome 
shotgun data, and have been finished to high quality.  
All euchromatic sequence has been compared to the restriction digest
fingerprints in multiple enzymes for validity.  The details of this
analysis will be described in a forthcoming publication. 
</P>
<P>
4.7 Mb of heterochromatic sequence from the
<a href="http://www.fruitfly.org/" target=_blank>
Drosophila Heterochromatin Genome Project</a> (DHGP)
is available on chr2LHet, chr2RHet, chr3LHet, chr3RHet, chrXHet, and chrYHet.
Scaffolds that could not be unambiguously mapped to a chromosome arm 
have been concatenated into chrU. chrUextra contains 34,630 small scaffolds
produced by the Celera shotgun assembler that could not be consistently
joined with larger scaffolds. Because some of the chrUextra data are of low 
quality, researchers are encouraged to contact either BDGP or DHGP for further 
details on this resource. For more information on this assembly, see the 
Release 5 <A HREF="http://www.fruitfly.org/sequence/README.RELEASE5"
