<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows areas of coverage for genomic regions of 3 alternate 
strains of chicken sequenced by the 
<A HREF="https://en.genomics.cn/" TARGET=_BLANK>
Beijing Genomics Institute</A> (BGI): Broiler, Layer, and Silkie.  
Single reads from those three strains were mapped to the 
reference assembly for the Red Jungle Fowl (RJF).  
</P>
<P>
Coverage area names are of the format 
[<em>strain</em>].[<em>chrom</em>].[<em>start</em>].[<em>end</em>]:

<UL>
