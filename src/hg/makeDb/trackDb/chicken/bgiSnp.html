<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and/or
insertions/deletions (indels) determined by the 
<A HREF="https://en.genomics.cn/" TARGET=_BLANK>
Beijing Genomics Institute</A> (BGI).  
Genomic sequence reads from 3 alternate strains of chicken (Broiler,
Layer and Silkie) were used to determine the SNPs relative to the
reference assembly for Red Jungle Fowl (RJF).

<P>
SNP names are of the format 
snp.[<em>supercontig</em>].[<em>contig</em>].[<em>position</em>].[<em>type</em>].[<em>strain</em>]:

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Sequence reads from the Broiler, Layer and Silkie strains were mapped
to the reference chicken assembly with blast. Then, cross_match was
used for the detailed base-by-base comparison.  The Phred quality
scores (-10 * log <SUB> 10</SUB> estimated error probability) are given for the 
SNP base(s) in the assembly and the (single read) SNP read.
