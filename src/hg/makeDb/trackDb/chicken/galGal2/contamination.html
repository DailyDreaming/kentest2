<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows locations of likely contamination in the assembly, 
e.g. high-scoring alignments of <em>E.coli</em>, vector and maize mitochondrion 
sequence.  The name of each feature indicates the type of contamination 
found there.  
</P>
<P>
The maize mitochondrion contamination (&quot;MAIZE_MITO&quot;) locations 
represent the entire whole genome shotgun (WGS) contig found to be contaminated.  
The <em>E.coli</em> and vector locations show only the contaminated portion of 
the affected WGS contig.
