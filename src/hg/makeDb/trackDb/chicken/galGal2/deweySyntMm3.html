<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows exon-anchored orthologous blocks for the $organism assembly and 
the mouse assembly (Feb. 2003 - mm3), taken from a 5-species orthology map 
(chicken, human, chimp, mouse, rat).  
The map is 1-to-1 and symmetric, so segment IDs are common to 
all pairwise tracks generated from the map.  
See 
<A HREF="http://hanuman.math.berkeley.edu/~cdewey/homologyMaps/" TARGET=_BLANK>

for an outline of the methods used to produce the map.
