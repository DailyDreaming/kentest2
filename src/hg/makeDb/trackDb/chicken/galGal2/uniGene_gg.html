<H2> Description </H2>

This track shows alignments of $organism 
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/unigene" target="_blank">UniGene</A>
sequences to the $organism genome.  

<H2> Methods </H2>

The alignments were done with 
<A HREF="https://genome.cshlp.org/content/12/4/656.abstract" TARGET=_blank>
blat</A>, with a minimum sequence identity of 95%.  
The alignments were filtered to keep only those with at least 20% coverage, 
at least 96.5% alignment ratio, and scores within 0.2% of best-in-genome.  
The $organism genome was masked with RepeatMasker and Tandem Repeats
Finder before running blat.
