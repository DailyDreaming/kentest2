<P>
This track shows the locations of supercontigs from the Whole Genome Shotgun 
assembly.  Supercontigs are composed of contigs separated by fragment gaps.  
The naming pattern for contigs is <tt>Contig<em>N</em>.<em>M</em></tt>, 
where <em>N</em> is the supercontig number (shared by all contigs in the 
same supercontig), and <em>M</em> is the number of the contig, i.e. its 
order within the supercontig.  
</P>
<P>
A single feature in this track denotes a series of contigs with the same 
supercontig number <em>N</em>.  The Assembly track shows the locations of 
individual contigs.

This track was generated at UCSC from the assembly AGP files.
