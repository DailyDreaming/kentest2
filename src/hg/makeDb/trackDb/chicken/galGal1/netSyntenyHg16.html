<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows the human/$organism chains for syntenic 
regions of the human assembly (July 2003 - hg16) and the $organism
assembly.  </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The Human/$Organism Alignment Net track (netHg16) was processed 
with netFilter -syn to produce this set of syntenic alignments.  </P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>The chainNet, netSyntenic, netFilter and netClass programs were
developed at the University of California
at Santa Cruz by Jim Kent.
