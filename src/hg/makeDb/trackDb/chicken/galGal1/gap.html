<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.  These gaps &mdash; with the
exception of intractable heterochromatic gaps &mdash; will be closed during the
finishing process. 
</P><P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is known, it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap. 
</P>
<P>This assembly contains the following principal types of gaps:
<UL>
<LI><B>Fragment</B> - gaps between the contigs of a supercontig.
(In this context, a contig is a set of overlapping sequence reads.)
These are represented by varying numbers of <em>N</em>s in the assembly if the 
gap size is known, 600 if ? and 8000 if ?.  
<LI><B>Clone</B> - gaps between clones in the same supercontig.  These are 
represented by 10,000 <em>N</em>s for all chromosomes except chrUn (concatenation 
of unplaced contigs), where gaps of 2,000 <em>N</em>s  are used.  
<LI><B>Contig</B> - gaps between supercontigs. These are represented by 10,000 
<em>N</em>s  in the assembly.
<LI><B>Centromere</B> - gaps from centromeres (1,500,000 <em>N</em>s for 
chromosomes 1-8 and Z; 500,000 <em>N</em>s for chromosomes 9-13, 17, and 26).
