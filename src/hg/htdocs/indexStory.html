On June 22, 2000, UCSC and the other members of the International Human Genome Project consortium
completed the first working draft of the human genome assembly, forever ensuring
free public access to the genome and the information it contains. A few weeks
later, on July 7, 2000, the newly assembled genome was released on the web at
http://genome.ucsc.edu, along with the initial prototype of a graphical viewing tool, the
UCSC Genome Browser. In the ensuing years, the website has grown to include a broad
collection of vertebrate and model organism assemblies and annotations, along with a large
suite of tools for viewing, analyzing and downloading data. Learn more about our history on the
