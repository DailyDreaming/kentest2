                    <p>The goal of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project is to build
                      a comprehensive catalog of candidate functional elements in the genome.
                      The catalog includes genes (protein-coding and non-protein coding),
                      transcribed regions, and regulatory elements, as well as information
                      about the tissues, cell types and conditions where they are found to be
                      active.  The current phase of ENCODE (2012-2016) greatly expands the
                      number of cell types, data types and assays and includes the study of
                      both the human and mouse genomes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Like the Human Genome Project, the ENCODE Project seeks rapid data
                      dissemination and use by the entire scientific community.
                      Accordingly, to encourage the widest possible use of the datasets,
                      all data produced will be available for unrestricted use immediately
                      upon release to public databases, eliminating the nine-month moratorium
                      previously used by ENCODE.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>External data users may freely download, analyze and publish results
                      based on any ENCODE data without restrictions as soon as they are
                      released.</b> This applies to all datasets, regardless of type or size,
                      and includes no grace period for ENCODE data producers, either as
                      individual members or as part of the Consortium. Researchers using
                      unpublished ENCODE data are encouraged to contact the data producers
                      to discuss possible coordinated publications; however, this is optional.
                      The Consortium will continue to publish the results of its own analysis
                      efforts in independent publications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We request that researchers who use ENCODE datasets (published or
                      unpublished) in publications and talks cite the ENCODE Consortium in
                      all of the following ways:
                    <ol>(1) Cite the Consortium's most recent
                      integrative publication
                      (PMID: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22955616" target="_blank">22955616</a>;

                    </ol>
                    <ol>(2) Reference the ENCODE Data Coordination Center (DCC) or GEO accession numbers of the datasets;
                    </ol>
                    <ol>(3) And acknowledge the ENCODE Consortium and the ENCODE production
                      laboratory(s) generating the particular dataset(s).
