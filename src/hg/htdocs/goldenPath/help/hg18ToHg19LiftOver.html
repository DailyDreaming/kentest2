<h1>LiftOver of tracks from hg18 to hg19</h1> 
<p> 
The tracks indicated by the logo <img class="gbsInlineImg" src = "../../../images/18.jpg" 
alt="hg18 LiftOver logo" width="20" height="20"> or 
<img class="gbsInlineImg" src = "../../../images/17.jpg" alt="hg19 LiftOver logo" 
width="20" height="20"> have been lifted from hg18 or hg17, respectively, with a 
minimum of quality control scrutiny. They are provided to our users with the intent that they 
assist in interpretation of other data, but must be used with caution. Not all annotations remain 
intact when lifted in this manner and in any case, cannot by definition contain any sequence that 
is new to hg19. </p> 
<p> 
It should also be noted that tracks containing large regions will lift less well because of the 
increased chance of spanning a region that changed between the two assemblies.</p>
