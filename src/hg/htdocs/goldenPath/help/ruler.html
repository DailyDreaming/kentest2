<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The Base Position feature in the Genome Browser annotations track image shows
the genomic coordinates of the displayed region and -- when zoomed in to the 
base level -- the base composition of the sequence underlying the annotation 
tracks display. To quickly zoom in to the base level, click the <em>base</em> 
zoom-in button. The <em>base</em> button may also be used to automatically 
zoom the window to maximize the base display when the image is resized. Click 
the arrow to the left of the base display to show the base complement. 
To toggle between dense and full display mode, click anywhere on the base
composition line. </p>
<p>
In dense display mode, clicking anywhere on the genome coordinate line will 
zoom-in the display, centered on the coordinate of the click. The degree of
the zoom may be configured through the Zoom configuration buttons (the default
is 3X). In full display mode, the track shows three frames of translation 
when viewed at the base level. Methionines (including potential start codons) 
are displayed in  green and labeled &quot;M&quot;. Stop codons are colored 
red and labeled with &quot;*&quot;. Codons within or on the boundaries of 
gaps, or at the ends of the chromosome, are colored black and labeled 
with an &quot;X&quot; to indicate an 
error (e.g. a truncated codon). All other codons are shown in alternating 
shades of gray to indicate codon boundaries and are labeled by the amino 
acids they represent. To view the translation on the reverse strand, click 
the arrow to complement the base display. </p>

To add a title to the top of the display browser display image, enter the text in
the Title textbox. To display the name and date of the assembly, check
the Assembly checkbox. To display the position and chromosome, check
the Position checkbox.<p>
