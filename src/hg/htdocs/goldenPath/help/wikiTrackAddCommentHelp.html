Your annotations will be tagged automatically with your genomewiki user 
name and a date/time stamp; there is no need to manually add this information.
Annotations are maintained by the wiki system.</p>
<p>
An annotation may be deleted only by the individual who added it to the Wiki 
track. Once deleted, the item will not appear on the Wiki track in
the Genome Browser display; however, the annotation text will remain in the 
genomewiki.  </p>
