<h1>Gene Haplotype Alleles</h1>

<div id='haplotypes'> <!-- Allows using same CSS as the haplotypes aplet itself  -->
<p>
The Gene Haplotype Alleles feature displays the chromosome-phased
<a href='http://www.1000genomes.org/' target="_blank">1000 Genomes</a> Phase 1 data for protein
coding regions. These data comprise the genomes of 1,092 individuals from 14 populations in Africa,
Europe, East Asia and the Americas, constructed using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome
and exome sequencing.</p>
<p>
The variant genotypes have been phased by the 1000 Genomes Project (<em>i.e.</em>, the two alleles
of each diploid genotype have been assigned to two haplotypes, one inherited from each parent).</p>

<h2>How to use the &quot;Gene Haplotype Alleles&quot; section</h2>
<p> 
Click on any protein-coding gene in the UCSC Genes track and scroll to the <strong>Common Gene 
Haplotype Alleles</strong> section. (The feature is currently implemented only on GRCh37/hg19 
protein-coding genes.) There will be a table of haplotypes for the protein-coding 
portion of the gene. Each row in the table represents a unique gene haplotype as found in 
the 1000 Genomes Phase 1 project data.  The table is sortable on any column by clicking on 
the column headers.  <!-- Note that if the gene is on the negative ('-' or &quot;reverse&quot;) 
strand, all variant sites and sequences will be presented with respect to the negative strand. 
This differs from the way variants are displayed in the 1000 Genomes phase 1 variations track,
which are always shown as they appear on the positive ('+' or "forward") strand. --></p> 

<dl>
  <dt><strong class='textOpt'>Haplotype Frequency</strong></dt>
  <dd>
  Haplotype frequencies are based upon all relevant chromosomes in the data set.  The total
  number is almost always 2,184 (1,092 for Y and location-dependent for X).  Hover over
  the frequency calculations to show the number of a particular haplotype in the dataset 
  (<em>e.g.</em>, <span title='N=1327 of 2184'>"N=1327 of 2184"</span>). If appropriate, the 
  homozygous frequency will also be shown and will reflect the number of individuals in the dataset.
  <br><br>
  The <em>reference haplotype</em> (made of entirely reference variants) may not be represented in 
  the 1000 Genomes data.  If it is, it will be so marked in the &quot;<strong>Ref</strong>&quot; 
  column.<br><br></dd>

  <dt><strong class='textOpt'>Variant sites</strong></dt>
  <dd>
  By default, only non-synonymous, <em>common variant</em> sites are displayed. Common variants
  are defined as occurring in at least 1&#37; of 1000 Genomes subject chromosomes.</p>
  <p>
  <input type='button' style='font-size:.9em;' value='Include all variants' 
  title='Include or Restrict to non-synonymous, common variants with a frequency of at least 1%' 
  onclick='return false;'> includes rare and synonymous variant sites found in 
  1000 Genomes subjects in the list of haplotypes.</p>
  <p>
  <input type='button' style='font-size:.9em;' value='Common variants only'
  title='Include or Restrict to non-synonymous, common variants with a frequency of at least 1%'

  <p>
  <input type='button' style='font-size:.9em;' value='Display as amino acids' 
  title='Display variants and sequence as amino acids or DNA bases' onclick='return false;'>
  displays variant sites (and full sequence) as predicted amino acids. Predicted stop codons
  are represented by &quot;]&quot; and predicted frameshifts by &quot;[>>]&quot;.</p>
  <p>
  The <em>reference variant</em> is shown at the top of each variant site column. This is the
  value found in the GRCh37/hg19 reference genome at that variant site. In most cases it is a
  single letter (AA code/DNA base). In the case of an insertion with respect to the reference
  genome, the reference value is shown as &quot;-&quot;. Large deletions are represented
  by the first two sequence letters followed by &quot;+++&quot;.</p>
  <p>
  Hovering the pointer over any of the variant site links will show a more complete description
  of that variant. For example, the variant description
  <strong><span title='AA:16 A|T chr9:136137554 SNP: G|A (0.995|0.005) rs55917063'>
              "AA:16 A|T chr9:136137554 SNP: G|A (0.995|0.005) rs55917063"</span></strong>
  consists of the following elements:
  <pre><strong>AA:16 A|T</strong> - AA residue number and variants (AA view only)
<strong>chr9:136137554</strong> - genome location
<strong>SNP: G|A (0.995|0.005)</strong> - nucleotide variants and allele frequencies
<strong>rs55917063</strong> - dbSNP variant name (if one is known) </pre>
  <p>
  Clicking on any
  <em>non-reference</em> variant shown in the variant sites columns 
  will link to the full details of that variant site in the 1000 Genomes phase 1 track.

  Each haplotype is found in one or more subjects participating in phase 1 of the 
  1000 Genomes project. The 1000 Genomes populations, <a href='#population'>defined below</a>,
  are grouped into broad categories (a.k.a.
  <a href="http://www.1000genomes.org/faq/which-populations-are-part-your-study"
  target="_blank">super populations</a>). Haplotype distributions are available both for 1000 
  Genomes populations and for the major groupings. They are hidden by default.
  <p>

  Each population group is shown as a column in the table, and each row shows the percent of 
  that haplotype that is found in each group.  This is not the same as the percent of each 
  group that has the haplotype.  Hover over the distribution numbers to show the 
  frequency of occurrence of the haplotype within each group.  For example, 
  <span title='N=304 of 1183 (found in 71.0&#37 of all ASN)'>hovering over <strong>25.7</strong> 
  might show "N=304 of 1183 (found in 71.0&#37 of all ASN)"</span>, 
  meaning that of the 1183 occurrences of the haplotype, 304 or 25.7&#37; are found in the 
  ASN group and that 71.0&#37; of all East Asian copies of this gene (in 1000 Genomes phase 1 
  data) match this haplotype.
  To see the number of 1000 genomes chromosomes covered for each group, hover over the

<h2 id='scoring'>Scoring definitions</h2>
<p class="gbsWarnText">Scores alone cannot be used to draw definitive conclusions about 
any haplotype.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><strong class='textOpt'>Hap score</strong></dt>
  <dd>
  The <strong>haplotype score</strong> is based on the normalized (-log<sub>10</sub>) probability of
  finding exactly N subject chromosomes with this haplotype, given the frequencies of individual 
  variants and assuming they are independent. The score is normalized by multiplying the base 
  probability by the total number of variants. Normalization allows comparing the scores 
  between genes with many variant sites and those with few. The score will be positive if the 
  haplotype is more frequent than expected by chance and negative if less frequent.  Larger 
  scores will result when minor variant alleles occur together more frequently 
  than expected, which might reflect co-selection or may merely be an artifact of more 
  recent events.  A negative haplotype score may be more informative. 
  For haplotypes made from common, non-synonymous variants, haplotype scores above 606 
  are seen in only 2&#37; of genes.  Likewise, a score of less than -199 is only seen 
  in 2&#37; of genes.<br><br></dd> 

  <dt><strong class='textOpt'>Hom score</strong></dt>
  <dd>The <strong>homozygous score</strong> is based upon the (-log<sub>10</sub>) probability of 
  finding exactly N individuals with this haplotype on both chromosomes, given the <em>actual</em> 
  frequency of the haplotype in subject chromosomes. The score will be positive if the 
  haplotype is found homozygous in more individuals than expected and negative when found 
  in fewer than expected.  Negative values might suggest that the haplotype is deleterious 
  when homozygous.  For haplotypes made from common, non-synonymous variants, homozygous 
  scores above 92 are seen in only 2&#37; of genes.  Likewise, a score of less than -15 is 
  only seen in 2&#37; of genes.<br><br></dd> 

  <dt><strong class='textOpt'>Pop score</strong></dt>
  <dd>
  The <strong>population score</strong> (only visible when population distributions are displayed)
  is the fixation index (F<sub>ST</sub>) based upon the difference in variance between
  sub-population haplotype frequencies and the total haplotype frequency.  Note that this 
  calculation is based upon the frequency of haplotype, rather than the distribution of that 
  haplotype across populations.  Nevertheless, large population scores should reflect large skews 
  in distribution in more frequently occurring haplotypes. For haplotypes made from common, 
  non-synonymous variants, population scores above 0.424 are seen in only 2&#37; of genes and scores
  above 0.506 are seen in only 1&#37; of genes.<br><br></dd>
