<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows the <em>In-silico</em> PCR alignment(s) of your primers to the genome assembly.  
The result is shown as solid blocks where the primers are located, with a double line indicating the
sequence between them. For assemblies that support isPCR on genesets, the results have a single line
between amplified regions, indicating where no amplified sequence would be found. Differences 
between the primer sequences and the reference genome sequence are indicated by primer base values 
at base level view, or red vertical lines when zoomed out.</p>
<p>
In the sequence displayed on the details page, the link in the fasta header goes to the Genome 
Browser at the given position. Between the start and end coordinates, there is a &quot;+&quot; if 
the primers matched the forward strand of the reference genome sequence, or a &quot;-&quot; if they 
matched the reverse strand. Bases are capitalized where the primer sequences and reference genome 
sequence agree. When a primer base does not match the genome sequence, the genomic base value is 
shown in lower case.</p>
