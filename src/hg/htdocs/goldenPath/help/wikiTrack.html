<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The Wiki track displays genome annotations added by the Genome Browser user community. These 
annotations have <strong><em>not</em></strong> been curated.</p>
<p>
As of June 2012, this track is a read-only track. Annotations are still available and viewable in 
the track, and all annotations can be viewed at the 
<a href="http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Category:Genome_Annotation" target="_blank">Genome 
Annotation</a> wiki page, but no new annotations are being accepted and existing annotations can 
no longer be freely edited.</p>

<h2>Policies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
  The UCSC Genome Browser group reserves the right to remove any annotations.</li>
  <li>
  Annotations are not curated by UCSC.</li>
</ul>
