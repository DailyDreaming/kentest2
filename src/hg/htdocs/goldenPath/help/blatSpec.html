<h1>Blat Suite Program Specifications and User Guide</h1> 
<p> 
Blat produces two major classes of alignments: 
<ul> 
  <li> 
  at the DNA level between two sequences that are of 95% or greater identity, but which may include 
  large inserts.</li> 
  <li> 
  at the protein or translated DNA level between sequences that are of 80% or greater identity and 
  may also include large inserts.</li> 
</ul>
<p> 
The output of blat is flexible. By default, it is a simple tab-delimited file that describes the 
alignment, but which does not include the sequence of the alignment itself. Alternatively, blat can produce output compatible with <a href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi" 
target="_blank">BLAST</a> or <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/sss/wublast/" 
target="_blank">WU-BLAST</a>, as well as several other formats.</p> 
<p> 
The main programs in the blat suite are: 
<ul> 
  <li> 
  <a href="#gfServerUsage">gfServer</a> &ndash; a server that maintains an index of the genome in 
  memory and uses the index to quickly find regions with high levels of sequence similarity to a 
  query sequence.</li>  
  <li> 
  <a href="#gfClientUsage">gfClient</a> &ndash; a program that queries gfServer over the network and
  does a detailed alignment of the query sequence with regions found by gfServer.</li>  
  <li> 
  <a href="#blatUsage">blat</a> &ndash; client and server combined into a single program, first 
  building the index, then using the index, and then exiting.</li>  
  <li> 
  <a href="#webBlatUsage">webBlat</a> &ndash; a web-based version of gfClient that presents the 
  alignments in an interactive fashion.</li>  
</ul> 
<p> 
Building an index of the genome typically takes 10 or 15 minutes. For interactive applications, it 
is typical to use gfServer to build a whole-genome index. gfClient or webBlat can then align a 
single query within a few seconds. When aligning a large number of sequences in a batch mode, it may
be more efficient to use blat, particularly if it is run on a cluster of computers. Each blat run is
typically done against a single chromosome, but with a large number of query sequences.</p> 
<p> 
Other programs in the blat suite are: 
<ul> 
  <li> 
  <a href="#pslSortUsage">pslSort</a> &ndash; combines and sorts the output of multiple blat runs. 
  The blat default output format is <a href="../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format2">psl</a>.</li> 
  <li> 
  <a href="#pslRepsUsage">pslReps</a> &ndash; selects the best alignments for a particular query 
  sequence, using a &quot;near best in genome&quot; approach.</li> 
  <li> 
  <a href="#pslPrettyUsage">pslPretty</a> &ndash; converts alignments from psl format, which is a 
  tab-delimited format that does not include the bases themselves, to a more readable alignment 
  format.</li>  
  <li> 
  <a href="#faToTwoBitUsage">faToTwoBit</a> &ndash; converts 
  <a href="http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph/FASTA.html" target="_blank">fasta</a> format sequence
  files to the dense, randomly accessible <a href="../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format7">.2bit</a> 
  format that gfClient can use.</li> 
  <li> 
  <a href="#twoBitToFaUsage">twoBitToFa</a> &ndash; converts from .2bit format back to fasta
  format.</li>
  <li> 
  <a href="#faToNibUsage">faToNib</a> &ndash; converts from fasta to the somewhat less dense, 
  randomly accessible <a href="../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format8">.nib</a> format that predated .2bit
  format. Note that each .nib file can contain only a single sequence.</li>  
  <li> 
  <a href="#nibFragUsage">nibFrag</a> &ndash; converts portions of a .nib file back to fasta 
  format.</li>
</ul> 
<p> 
Usage details for each of the above programs are described in the sections below. For all programs 
except webBlat, the usage options may also be viewed by typing the name of the program (without 
arguments) on the UNIX command line.</p> 
<p> 
The gfServer program requires approximately 1 byte of memory for every 3 bases in the genome it is 
indexing in DNA mode, and 1.5 bytes for each unmasked base in translated mode. The blat program 
requires approximately 2 bytes of memory for each base in the genome in DNA mode, and 3 bytes of 
memory for each base in translated mode. The other programs use relatively little memory.</p> 
<p> 
You may also be interested in the following programs that are not part of the blat suite: 
<ul> 
  <li> 
  in-silico PCR &ndash; quickly finds the sequence between two primers. This includes webPCR, an 
  interface similar to webBlat.</li>  
  <li> 
  <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">Genome Browser</a> &ndash; displays annotations as a series of 
  tracks on top of the genome.</li>

<h2>blat</h2> 
<p>
<strong>blat</strong> &ndash; Standalone blat sequence search command line tool.</p> 
<p>
Usage:</p>
<pre><code>blat database query [-ooc=11.ooc] output.psl</code></pre>
<p>
Where:</p>
<pre><code>database and query are each either a .fa, .nib, or .2bit file, or a list of these files, one file 
name per line. 

-ooc=11.ooc tells the program to load over-occurring 11-mers from an external file. This will 
increase the speed by a factor of 40 in many cases, but is not required.

output.psl is the output file.

Subranges of .nib and .2bit files may be specified using the syntax:
   /path/file.nib:seqid:start-end
or
   /path/file.2bit:seqid:start-end
or
   /path/file.nib:start-end

With the second form, a sequence id of file:start-end is used.</code></pre>

<p>
Options:</p>
<pre><code>-t=type                Database type, one of:
                          dna - (default) DNA sequence
                          prot - protein sequence
                          dnax - DNA sequence translated in six frames to protein

-q=type                Query type, one of:
                          dna - DNA sequence
                          rna - RNA sequence
                          prot - protein sequence
                          dnax - DNA sequence translated in six frames to protein
                          rnax - DNA sequence translated in three frames to protein

-prot                  Synonymous with -t=prot -q=prot

-ooc=N.ooc             Use overused tile file N.ooc. N should correspond to the tileSize.

-tileSize=N            Sets the size of match that triggers an alignment. Usually between 8 and 12. 
                       Default is 11 for DNA and 5 for protein.

-stepSize=N            Spacing between tiles. Default is tileSize.

-oneOff=N              If set to 1, this allows one mismatch in tile and still triggers an 
                       alignment. Default is 0.

-minMatch=N            Sets the number of tile matches. Usually set from 2 to 4.  Default is 2 for 
                       nucleotide, 1 for protein.

-minScore=N            Sets minimum score. This is the matches minus the mismatches minus some sort 
                       of gap penalty. Default is 30.

-minIdentity=N         Sets minimum sequence identity (in percent). Default is 90 for nucleotide 
                       searches, 25 for protein or translated protein searches.

-maxGap=N              Sets the size of maximum gap between tiles in a clump. Usually set from 0 to 
                       3. Default is 2. Relevant only for minMatch > 1.

-noHead                Suppresses .psl header (so it's just a tab-separated file).

-makeOoc=N.ooc         Makes overused tile file. Target must be complete genome.

-repMatch=N            Sets the number of repetitions of a tile allowed before it is marked as 
                       overused. Typically this is 256 for tileSize 12, 1024 for tile size 11, 
                       4096 for tile size 10. Default is 1024. Typically needed only with makeOoc. 
                       Also affected by stepSize: when stepSize is halved, repMatch is doubled to 
                       compensate.

-mask=type             Masks out repeats. Alignments won't be started in masked region but may 
                       extend through it in nucleotide searches. Masked areas are ignored entirely 
                       in protein or translated searches. Types are:
                             lower - masks out lower-cased sequence
                             upper - masks out upper-cased sequence
                             out - masks according to database.out RepeatMasker .out file
                             file.out - masks database according to RepeatMasker file.out

-qMask=type            Masks out repeats in query sequence. Similar to -mask above but for query 
                       rather than target sequence.

-repeats=type          Type is same as mask types above. Repeat bases will not be masked in any way,
                       but matches in repeat areas will be reported separately from matches in other
                       areas in the psl output.

-minRepDivergence=NN   Minimum percent divergence of repeats to allow them to be unmasked. Default 
                       is 15. Relevant only for masking using RepeatMasker .out files.

-dots=N                Outputs a dot every N sequences to show program's progress.

-trimT                 Trims leading poly-T.

-noTrimA               Don't trim trailing poly-A.

-trimHardA             Removes poly-A tail from qSize as well as alignments in psl output.

-fastMap               Run for fast DNA/DNA remapping, not allowing introns and requiring high %ID.

-out=type              Controls output file format, one of:
                           psl - (Default) tab-separated format, no sequence
                           pslx - tab separated format with sequence
                           axt - blastz-associated axt format
                           maf - multiz-associated maf format
                           sim4 - similar to sim4 format
                           wublast - similar to wublast format
                           blast - similar to NCBI blast format
                           blast8 - NCBI blast tabular format
                           blast9 - NCBI blast tabular format with comments

-fine                  For high-quality mRNAs, looks harder for small initial and terminal exons. 
                       Not recommended for ESTs.

-maxIntron=N           Sets maximum intron size. Default is 750000.

-extendThroughN        Allows extension of alignment through large blocks of Ns. </code></pre>

    pslSort g2g[1|2] outFile tempDir inDir(s)

Appending [1|2] to the &quot;dirs&quot; or &quot;g2g&quot; option limits the program to only the 
first or second pass of the sort.</code></pre>
<p>
Options:</p>
<pre><code>-nohead     Suppress the psl header.

-verbose=N  Set verbosity level, higher for more output. Default is 1.</code></pre>
<p> 
Note: pslSort will run out of memory on extremely large files. It may be preferable to use this 
UNIX command in these situations:  
<pre><code>sort -k 10 *.psl > sorted.psl</code></pre>
<p> 
In this case, remove the header lines from the .psl input file using the &quot;-noHead&quot; option 
to blat before using the UNIX sort command.</p>

<h2>Setting up WebBlat</h2> 
<p> 
<strong>Installing webBlat</strong></p> 
<p> 
Installing a web-based blat server involves four major steps:</p> 
<ol> 
  <li> 
  Create the sequence databases.</li> 
  <li> 
  Run the gfServer program to create in-memory indexes of the databases.</li>  
  <li>
  Edit the webBlat.cfg file to set the machine and port that the gfServer(s) are running on, and to 
  optionally customize the webBlat appearance for users.</li>  
  <li>
  Copy the webBlat executable and webBlat.cfg to a directory where the web server can execute 
  webBlat as a cgi.</li>  
</ol> 
<p> 
<strong>Creating sequence databases</strong></p> 
<p> 
Create databases with the program faToTwoBit. Typically, a separate database is created for each 
genome being indexed. Each database can contain up to four billion bases of sequence in an unlimited
number of records. The databases for webPcr and webBlat are identical.</p>
<p> 
The input to faToTwoBit is one or more fasta format files, each of which can contain multiple 
records. If the sequence contains repeat sequences, as is the case with vertebrates and many plants,
the repeat sequences can be represented in lower-case and the other sequence in upper-case. The 
gfServer program can then be configured to ignore the repeat sequences. The output of faToTwoBit is 
a file that is designed for fast random access and efficient storage. The output file stores four 
bases per byte, and uses a small amount of additional space to store the case of the DNA and to keep
track of blocks of Ns in the input. Other ambiguity codes in the input sequence, such as Y and U, 
will be converted to N.</p> 
<p> 
Here is an example of how a typical installation might create a mouse and a human genome
database:</p> 
<pre><code>cd /data/genomes
mkdir twoBit
faToTwoBit human/hg19/*.fa  twoBit/hg19.2bit
faToTwoBit mouse/mm10/*.fa  twoBit/mm10.2bit </code></pre> 
<p> 
It is not necessary to put all of the databases in the same directory, but it can simplify 
bookkeeping. The databases can use the older blat format, .nib, instead of the .2bit format. The 
.nib format packs only two bases per byte, and handles only one record per .nib file.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Creating in-memory indexes with gfServer</strong></p> 
<p> 
The gfServer program creates an in-memory index of a nucleotide sequence database that can be used 
for translated or untranslated searches. Translated indexes enable protein-based blat queries and 
use approximately two bytes per unmasked base in the database. Untranslated indexes are used for 
nucleotide-based blat queries and the in-silico PCR utility. A normal blat index uses approximately 
one-quarter of a byte per base. For blat on smaller (primer-sized) queries or for in-silico PCR, it 
is recommended that you use a more thorough index that requires one-half of a byte per base. The 
gfServer program is memory intensive but typically does not require a lot of CPU power. With 
sufficient memory, multiple gfServers can be run on the same machine.</p> 
<p> 
Here is an example of a typical installation:</p> 
<pre><code>ssh bigRamMachine
cd /data/genomes/twoBit
gfServer start bigRamMachine 17779 hg19.2bit &
gfServer -trans -mask start bigRamMachine 17778 hg19.2bit & </code></pre> 
<p> 
The &quot;trans&quot; flag creates a translated index. It requires approximately 15 minutes to build
an untranslated index and 45 minutes to build a translated index.</p> 
<p> 
To build an untranslated index to be shared with in-silico PCR:</p> 
<pre><code>gfServer -stepSize=5 bigRamMachine 17779 hg19.2bit & </code></pre> 
<p> 
This index will be slightly more sensitive with blat, particularly for small query sequences.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Editing the webBlat.cfg file</strong></p> 
<p> 
The webBlat.cfg file tells the webBlat program where to look for gfServers and sequence. The basic 
format of the .cfg file is line-oriented. The first word of each line is a command, and lines that 
are blank or start with &quot;#&quot; are ignored. The webBlat.cfg and webPcr.cfg files are similar.
The webBlat.cfg commands are:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li> 
  gfServer &ndash; defines the host and port on which the (untranslated) gfServer is running, the 
  associated sequence directory, and the name of the database to display on the web page.</li>  
  <li> 
  gfServerTrans &ndash; defines the location of a translated server.</li>  
  <li> 
  background &ndash; (optional) defines the background image (if any) to display on the web 
  page.</li>  
  <li> 
  company &ndash; (optional) defines the company name to display on the web page.</li>  
  <li> 
  tempDir &ndash; specifies where to put temporary files. This path is relative to the directory 
  where the web server executes CGI scripts. It is recommended that an automated mechanism, such as 
  a cron job, be put in place to periodically remove files that haven't been recently accessed.</li>
</ul> 
<p> 
The background and company commands are optional. The webBlat.cfg file must have at least one valid 
gfServer or gfServerTrans line, and a tempDir line.</p> 
<p> 
Here is an example of a webBlat.cfg file that you might find for a typical webBlat installation:</p>
<pre><code>company Awesome Research Amalgamated
background /images/dnaPaper.jpg
gfServerTrans bigRamMachine 17778 /data/genomes/twoBit/hg19.2bit Human Genome
gfServer bigRamMachine 17779 /data/genomes/twoBit/hg19.2bit Human Genome
gfServerTrans mouseServer 17780 /data/genomes/twoBit/mm10.2bit Mouse Genome
gfServer mouseServer 17781 /data/genomes/twoBit/mm10.2bit Mouse Genome
tempDir ../trash </code></pre> 
<p> 
<strong>Locating webBlat</strong></p> 
<p> 
The details of this step vary highly among web servers. Unless you are administering your own 
computer, you will likely have to ask your local system administrators for help with this part of 
the webBlat installation. Here is an example of a typical installation of Apache:</p> 
<pre><code>ssh webServer
cd kent/webBlat
cp webBlat webBlat.cfg /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/
mkdir /usr/local/apache/trash
chmod 777 /usr/local/apache/trash </code></pre> 
<p> 
In the above example, the executable and configuration file reside in the directory kent/webBlat/. 
The program will create some files in the trash directory. It is advisable to periodically remove 
old files from this directory.</p> 
<p> 
Here is an example of an installation on Mac OS X:</p> 
<pre><code>cp webBlat webBlat.cfg /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/
mkdir /Library/WebServer/trash
chmod 777 /Library/WebServer/trash </code></pre>
