<h1>Configuring Multi-View Tracks</h1> 
<p>
The drop-down menus in the <em>Select views</em> section control the kind of data tracks that will 
be displayed, such as &quot;peaks&quot; or &quot;signal&quot;. To configure the display of the 
tracks for each data type, click on the name of the view next to the drop-down menu. Note that when 
a view has been set to <em>hide</em> in this section, the corresponding subtracks will have 
grayed-out checkboxes in the <em>List subtracks</em> section below.</p>
<p>
<strong>Selecting subtracks</strong><br>
The <em>Select subtracks</em> section is a grid of checkboxes that provides a quick way to select a 
set of subtracks according to some attribute, such as &quot;cell line&quot; or &quot;antibody&quot;.
Note that selections made using these boxes reset any selections made on the individual subtracks 
in the <em>List subtracks</em> section below.</p>
<p> 
Some tracks allow you to <em>Select subtracks further by</em> additional categories such as 
&quot;treatment&quot;. Click on a menu to see all of the available choices. Choices that are not 
compatible with the current set of selected subtracks may be grayed out. Click on one or more 
choices to select them.</p>
<p>
The <em>List subtracks</em> section allows you to select and deselect individual subtracks. This 
section provides the most refined control of the tracks displayed. Selections made here do not 
change the selections made in the <em>Select views</em> or <em>Select subtracks</em> sections above.Note that if the subtrack list is restricted to &quot;only selected/visible&quot; then some 
available subtracks may be hidden from the list. If the list of subtracks is long, this may be 
useful.</p>
<p>
<strong>Sorting subtracks</strong><br>
The order of subtracks in the <em>List subtracks</em> section determines the display position on the
main Genome Browser display page. Tracks can be sorted by clicking on the attribute links at the top
of the column (if any). The arrows next to the attribute links indicate which direction the columns 
are being sorted. The numbers next to the arrows indicate the priority of the sort for each 
attribute. Additionally, some subtracks can be ordered by &quot;drag and drop&quot;: click and hold 
a subtrack checkbox in the <em>List subtracks</em> section and release it in a new position. Note 
that tracks may be reordered by &quot;drag and drop&quot; in the main Genome Browser display. Those 
changes will not be reflected in this list.</p>
<p>
<strong>Configuring individual subtracks</strong><br>
Subtracks can have display and configuration settings that are distinct from the set they belong 
to. Click on the display mode (hide, dense, etc.) of a subtrack shown in the <em>List subtracks</em>
to change it or click on the wrench icon (<img class="gbsInlineImg" src="../../images/wrench.png" 
alt="Wrench Icon" width="15" height="15">) to change the configuration settings for an individual 
subtrack.  Individual subtrack settings will be overwritten anytime the set of tracks is configured 
as a whole.</p>
<p>
<strong>More details</strong><br>
To learn more about the underlying data for a subtrack, press the down arrow 
(<img class="gbsInlineImg" src="../../images/downBlue.png" alt="Down arrow" width="15" height="15">)
next to the subtrack name in the <em>List subtracks</em> section. This section will expand to 
display information such as the name of the data contributor, the cell line and antibody used in the
experiment, the data submission date and more. To see a full description of the underlying table, 
press the &quot;schema&quot; link.</p>
<p>
<strong>Selecting filter categories</strong><br>
Some tracks allow you to control the items that appear in displayed subtracks using <em>Filter 
items by</em> categories. Click on a filter menu to see all of the available item types. Click on 
one or more item types to select them.</p>
<p>
<strong>Selecting highlighting categories</strong><br> 
Some tracks allow you to highlight the items by various attributes using <em>Highlight items by</em>
categories. Click on a highlight menu to see all of the available item types. Click on one or more 
item types to select them.</p>
