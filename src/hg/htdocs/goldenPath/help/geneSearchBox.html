<h1>How to use the Search Box to find a gene</h1> 
<p> 
The search box accepts input in several <a href="query.html">formats</a>. The search box has a gene 
name auto-complete feature that suggests matches and takes users directly to the 
position of the UCSC/Known Genes or Refseq record associated with the gene, bypassing a search 
of the entire database.</p>

<p> 
To use this functionality, start typing the gene name into the search box; it will suggest 
gene names after 2 or more characters are entered. These suggestions can be clicked, bringing you
immediately to the position of the item you clicked. Alternately, if you finish typing and hit
&quot;Go&quot; or &quot;Enter&quot;, this will bring up a full list of up to 500 search results.
