Use the above form to add a new annotation to the Wiki Track.</p>
<p>
The annotation position defaults to the region currently displayed in your browser window. To change
the position setting, type a new coordinate range in the <em>position</em> text box above. 
Alternatively, you can adjust the range graphically by clicking &quot;cancel&quot; to return to the 
browser window, adjusting the display position, then clicking on the &quot;Make new entry&quot; 
link again to return to this form.</p>
<p>
If you don't wish to specify an item name, simply leave the default <em>wikiDefaultName</em> label 
in place and a unique name will be assigned to your annotation after submission.</p>
<p>
Your new annotation will be tagged automatically with your genomewiki user name and a date/time 
stamp; there is no need to manually add this information. Comments are maintained by the wiki 
system.  We recommend that you use the genomewiki editing interface for subsequent changes to this 
annotation, particularly those that are extensive in nature. You can access this interface by 
clicking on the annotation in the Wiki Track display.</p>
