<p>
Region definitions are ordinary 3- or 4-field bed file format. For example:</p>
<pre>#  comment lines can be included starting with the # symbol
chrX   151073054   151173000
chrX   151183000   151190000  optionalRegionName
chrX   151283000   151290000
chrX   151383000   151390000 </pre>
<p>
There is a limit of 1,000 defined regions. Using the upload file function will replace any existing 
regions. The fourth field, name, is optional and for notation purposes only; it is not used in the 
Table Browser. These are 0-relative coordinates, i.e. the first base on a chromosome is at
position 0.</p>
<p>
Coordinates can also be entered in the form:
<pre>chrX:151,283,001-151,290,000  optionalRegionName </pre>
These are 1-relative coordinates, i.e. the first base on a chromosome is at position 1.</p>
