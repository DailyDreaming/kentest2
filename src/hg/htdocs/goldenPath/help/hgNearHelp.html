<h2>Introduction</h2> 
<p> 
Genes function and evolve together.To  understand a gene, you often need to understand an entire 
gene family. Many such families are already known and described, such as the HOX family that 
mediates many aspects of limb and brain development and the Cytochrome P450 family that is central 
to the metabolism of many medications.</p> 
<p> 
One easy way to identify well-known relatives of a gene is by looking for genes with name 
similarity, because biologists tend to use similar names for similar genes. However, scientists only
partly understand the function of perhaps one-third of the genes of the genome; therefore, other 
techniques for grouping genes into families are necessary.</p>  
<p> 
The UCSC Gene Sorter is an excellent resource for exploring gene families and the relationships 
among genes. This tool displays a table of genes within a selected genome that are related to one 
another. Several different relationships may be explored: protein-level homology, similarity of gene
expression profiles, or genomic proximity. The Gene Sorter supports searches on a variety of terms 
and phrases, including the gene name, the UniProtKB protein name, a GenBank accession, or a word or 
phrase present in a gene's description. The gene family display is highly configurable, allowing the
user to control the order and number of columns, the number of rows, and the genes displayed. The 
tool provides several output formats, including a simple tab-delimited format that may be imported 
into a spreadsheet or a relational database.</p> 
<p> 
An important use of the Gene Sorter is to gather together a collection of genes that share similar 
properties for statistical analysis. For instance, one might want to examine promoter regions of 
genes that share a similar expression pattern  or look for protein sequence motifs in genes that 
share similar GO annotations.</p>  
<p> 
One of the most powerful features of the Gene Sorter is its filtering capabilities. The filter 
enables the user to quickly select an interesting subset of the 25,000 genes in the genome based on 
a variety of detailed and flexible selection criteria. For example, the filter may be used to select
all human genes over-expressed in the cerebellum that have GO-annotated G-protein coupled receptor 
activity.</p> 
<p> 
The Gene Sorter was designed and implemented by Jim Kent, Fan Hsu, David Haussler, and the UCSC 
Genome Bioinformatics Group. This work is supported by a grant from the National Human Genome 
Research Institute and by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2> 
<p> 
To begin using the Gene Sorter, you will first have to select a genomic region and the type of gene 
relationship you wish to display. You may also want to change some of the Gene Sorter's 
configuration settings to tailor the display to your research needs. These configuration options are
described in <a href="#Configure">Configuring the Gene Sorter display</a>.</p> 
<p>

<a name="Table"></a> 
<h2>Understanding the Gene Sorter display</h2> 
<p> 
The main page of the Gene Sorter displays a table containing rows of genes and associated 
attributes. In most cases, the currently-selected gene is shown at the top of the list, highlighted 
in light green. The remaining genes are ordered relative to the selected gene based on the sort 
criteria specified in the <em>sort by</em> menu. For example, in a table sorted by gene distance, 
the genes are listed in order of greater to lesser chromosomal proximity to the selected gene.</p> 
<p>				
The initial Gene Sorter display shows only a default subset of the columns available. The set of 
columns may be expanded, reduced, and rearranged by using the Gene Sorter's 
<a href="#Configure">configuration utility</a>. To view information about the data shown in the 
column, click on the column's label.</p> 
<p> 
To select a different gene in the table, click on the name of the gene. The Gene Sorter will move 
the gene entry to the top of the list and highlight it. The remaining genes will be reordered 
relative to the new selection.</p>  
<p>  
<strong>Column descriptions</strong> (listed in alphabetical order)</p> 
<ul> 
  <li> 
  <strong># column:</strong> Displays the position of each gene in the table, which is useful when 
  examining data in tables with many rows. Clicking on the gene number selects it and moves it to 
  the top of the list.</li> 
  <li>	
  <strong>3' UTR Fold column:</strong> Shows the estimated energy in kcal/mol of folding the 3' UTR 
  of a gene into the best predicted secondary structure. The energy calculations and secondary 
  structure predictions were obtained from the RNAfold program, which is part of the Vienna RNA 
  Package.</li> 
  <li>	
  <strong>5' UTR Fold column:</strong> Shows the estimated energy in kcal/mol of folding the 5' UTR 
  of a gene into the best predicted secondary structure. The energy calculations and secondary 
  structure predictions were obtained from the RNAfold program, which is part of the Vienna RNA 
  Package.</li> 
  <li>  
  <strong>Abundance column (Yeast):</strong> Displays protein abundance information, as reported in 
  Ghaemmaghami et al. <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6959/abs/nature02046.html"
  target="_blank">Global analysis of protein expression in yeast</a>, <em>Nature</em> 
  <strong>425</strong>(6959), 737-741 (2003). For more information, see the 
  <a href="http://yeastgfp.yeastgenome.org/" target="_blank">Yeast GFP Fusion Localization 
  Database</a>.</li> 
  <li>  
  <strong>Arbeitman et al. 2002 Life-Cycle Expression Data column (Fruitfly):</strong> Shows the 
  median ratio of gene expression in various phases of the fly life cycle relative to the expression
  of the gene in mixed egg-to-adult cultures. The level of detail may be increased or decreased with
  the <a href="#Configure">configuration utility</a>. See the <a href="#Expression">Expression 
  columns</a> description for more information about the display and configuration of this column. 
  For more details about the experiments and methods used to create this data, click on the column's
  label.</li> 
  <li>	
  <strong>BLASTP Bits column:</strong> Shows the bit score measure of protein similarity between a 
  gene and the selected gene. The greater the similarity between two proteins, the higher the bit 
  score. For more information about how the bit score was calculated, click on the Bits column 
  label.</li> 
  <li>  
  <strong>BLASTP E-Value column:</strong> Shows the Blastp E-value (expectation value) between each 
  gene and the selected gene. The greater the similarity of two proteins, the lower the E-value is. 
  Identical long proteins have an E-value of zero. Formally, an E-value is the number of other known
  genes that are expected to have at least this level of homology by chance. An E-value of less than
  0.1 can be safely interpreted as the probability that a match this good would occur merely by 
  chance. For more information about how the E-value was calculated, click on the E-Value column 
  label. Clicking on a gene's E-value displays an alignment between the gene and the selected 
  (highlighted) gene.</li> 
  <li>  
  <strong><em>C. elegans</em> column:</strong> Shows the best Blastp match to the WormBase protein 
  set. Clicking on the ID number displays the corresponding WormBase database record.</li> 
  <li>  
  <strong>Coding SNPs column:</strong> Shows the Simple Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) located in 
  the coding region of each gene. Clicking on a SNP ID displays the SNP record associated with the 
  gene in NCBI's dbSNP.</li> 
  <li>  
  <strong>Description column:</strong> Shows a brief description of each gene taken from its mRNA 
  record. Clicking on a description displays a page showing additional information and links for the
  gene.</li> 
  <li>  
  <strong>Drosophila column:</strong> Shows the FlyBase ID of the best Blastp match to the FlyBase 
  protein set. Clicking on the FlyBase ID displays the corresponding FlyBase report.</li> 
  <li>  
  <strong>Ensembl column:</strong> Shows the Ensembl transcript ID associated with the gene. 
  Ensembl is an automatic gene prediction pipeline and a major genome database and web site run by 
  the Sanger Institute and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI). It is especially 
  effective at mapping genes that are known in one organism to another organism. Compared to other 
  gene predictions, those of Ensembl tend to have high specificity but low sensitivity to genes not 
  already associated with characterized mRNA or protein sequence. Clicking on an Ensembl ID displays
  the Ensembl GeneView page for the gene.</li>
  <li>  
  <strong>Entrez Gene (Human):</strong> Formerly LocusLink. Shows the NCBI Entrez Gene ID associated
  with the gene. Clicking on the entry displays the Entrez Gene record. If the record shows a link 
  to the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) -- indicated by an orange square with an
  &quot;O&quot; inside it -- an OMIM record is available for the gene.</li> 
  <li>  
  <strong>Exon Count column:</strong> Displays the number of exons in the gene (coding and 
  non-coding).</li> 
  <li>  
  <strong>Exp Delta column:</strong> Shows the similarity of the expression of each gene to the 
  selected gene. Genes with identical expression profiles have a value of 0. This column shows data 
  only for the 1000 genes (including splicing variants) that have the most similar expression 
  profiles. For more information about how expression distance was calculated, click on the Exp 
  Delta column label.</li> 
  <a name="Expression"></a> 
  <li>  
  <strong>Expression columns:</strong> Show the ratio of expression of the gene in selected tissues 
  or life cycle stages to the expression of the gene overall. A gene that is more highly expressed 
  is colored red, and a less expressed gene is shown in green. The values are colored on a 
  logarithmic scale. This coloring is standard, but is the opposite of what an inexperienced user 
  might expect: in this case, red means go and green means stop! Black indicates that a gene is 
  neither over nor under expressed in the tissue. Uncolored boxes (white on most browsers) represent
  missing data. Various attributes of the expression column displays may be configured using the 
  <a href="#Configure">configuration utility</a>. Depending on the organism, the user may adjust the
  color scheme and brightness, toggle between expression ratio and absolute expression values, and 
  increase or decrease the level of detail shown. In particular, color-blind users may wish to 
  switch the coloring from red/green to yellow/blue. For more information about the selection 
  criteria used for expression	columns, click on the column's label.</li> 
  <li>  
  <strong>GenBank column:</strong> Shows the GenBank RefSeq or mRNA accession number associated with
  the gene. Clicking on the accession number displays the GenBank record associated with it.</li> 
  <li>  
  <strong>Gene Ontology column:</strong> Shows the Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with the 
  gene. GO terms are words from a controlled vocabulary assigned to a gene by human curators. 
  Clicking on a GO term displays the associated Gene Ontology Consortium database record.</li> 
  <li>

  <strong>GNF Atlas2 column (Human):</strong> Shows the ID of the probe in the GNF Atlas 2 that 
  overlaps most with the selected gene. The GNF Altas 2 is based on two Affymetrix chips: the 
  U133A and a custom-designed GNF1H chip.</li> 
  <li> 
  <strong>GNF Delta column:</strong> Shows the similarity of the expression of each gene to the 
  selected gene.  Genes with identical expression profiles have a value of 0. This column shows data
  only for the 1000 genes (including splicing variants) that have the most similar expression 
  profiles.</li> 
  <li>

<p>
The configuration table shows all the columns available for the currently-selected genome, listed in
left-to-right display order. To add or remove a column from the Gene Sorter display, click the
<em>On</em> checkbox to toggle the setting (a check indicates that the column is displayed). To 
quickly change the <em>On</em> settings of all columns, click the <em>Hide All</em> or 
<em>Show All</em> button at the top of the page. Click the <em>Submit</em> button to display the 
changes in the Gene Sorter.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Changing the column positions</strong><br> 
In addition to adding or removing columns, it is also possible to move the columns to the left or 
right within the Gene Sorter table. The order of the column names in the configuration table 
indicates the current relative position of the columns in the Gene Sorter display from left to 
right. To shift a column one position to the left, click the <em>up</em> arrow in the item's 
<em>Position</em> column. Similarly, click the <em>down</em> arrow to shift a column to the right. 
When you have finished making changes, click the <em>Submit</em> button.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Changing the expression colors</strong><br> 
By default, the gene expression ratios are shown using a red/green color scheme, where red indicates
a gene that is more highly expressed and green corresponds to less expression. Color-blind users may
find it helpful to switch the coloring from red/green to yellow/blue. To do so, select the 
&quot;yellow high/blue low&quot; option from the <em>Expression ratio colors</em> pull-down menu on 
the Configuration page, then click the <em>Submit</em> button.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Changing the brightness of expression colors</strong><br> 
To increase or decrease the brightness of the colors in an expression column, edit the 
<em>brightness</em> value for the corresponding entry in the configuration table. Values greater 
than 1.0 increase the brightness, while those less than 1.0 dim the color. Click the <em>Submit</em>
button to display the new values.</p>  
<p> 
<strong>Changing the type of tissue data shown in expression columns</strong><br>
By default, the expression columns show the median ratio of expression of a gene in a small selected
set of tissues. Use the the <em>tissues</em> pull-down menu to configure the tissue display for the 
column. The &quot;all replicas&quot; option will show the value of each individual experimental 
replica of each tissue. The &quot;median of replicas&quot; option displays a single value for each 
tissue that represents the median of all replicas for that tissue.</p>  
<p> 
<strong>Toggling between ratio and absolute expression values </strong><br> 
By default, expression columns show the ratio of expression of a gene relative to expression of the 
gene overall. To view absolute expression values instead, select the &quot;absolute&quot; option 
from the <em>values</em> pull-down menu.</p>  
<p> 
<strong>Displaying splicing variants</strong><br> 
By default, the Gene Sorter shows only one splicing variant: the one that produces the largest 
protein. To show all splicing variants, click the <em>Show all splicing variants</em> checkbox. Note
that in most cases, the column values (and sometimes the names) will be identical across
variants.</p>  
<p> 
<strong>Restoring the default settings</strong><br> 
At any time during your Gene Sorter session, you can restore the Gene Sorter table to its default 
layout by clicking the <em>Default</em> button on the Configuration page, then clicking 
<em>Submit</em>.</p>  
<p> 
<strong>Saving a configuration for future use</strong><br> 
The Gene Sorter configuration utility allows you to store multiple configurations for use in future 
sessions. This feature is particularly useful if you require different layouts for different 
research uses. To save the current configuration of the Gene Sorter layout, click the <em>Save</em> 
button on the Configuration page. Type in a name for the configuration in the text box at the top of
the page, then click <em>Save</em>.</p>  
<p> 
<strong>Loading a previously-saved configuration</strong><br> 
Once you have saved a configuration, you can load it back into your Gene Sorter in a future session.
To load a configuration, click the <em>Load</em> button on the Configuration page. The Gene Sorter 
will display a list of the names of your saved configurations. Click on a name to highlight it, then
click <em>Load</em> to reconfigure your Gene Sorter based on the saved settings.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Viewing a list of saved configurations</strong><br> 
To display a list of configurations that you have saved, click the <em>Save</em> button on the 
Configuration page. If you have any saved configurations, the Gene Sorter will display an 
<em>Existing Setups</em> list that shows the configuration names. To permanently remove a 
configuration from the list, click on the name to highlight it, then click the <em>Delete Existing 
Setup</em> button.</p>

<!-- Filtering the gene display -->
<a name="Filter"></a> 
<h2>Filtering the gene display</h2> 
<p> 
The Gene Sorter's gene filtering capabilities provide a versatile way to fine-tune the display to 
show just the genes in which you are interested. Filters are applied to individual gene fields, and 
may be combined to increase the specificity of the search. To access the Filter page, click the 
<em>filter</em> button at the top of the Gene Sorter page.</p>  
<p> 
At any time during the filter setup process, you can click the <em>List Names</em> button on the 
Filter page to view a list of genes that will be returned when the current filter settings are 
applied to the genome. You may find this list helpful in fine-tuning the filter.</p>  
<p> 
<strong>Filtering based on matching one or more terms</strong><br> 
Filters based on names, IDs, or other words restrict the display to only those genes that match one 
or more terms typed into the <em>search</em> text box. Examples of values that can be filtered on 
this basis include the gene name, RefSeq accession number, gene description, coding SNPs, and GO 
terms.</p>  
<p> 
This search supports wildcard matching on &quot;*&quot; and &quot;?&quot;. Multiple terms must be 
separated by a space or tab. For example, the search criteria "HOXA9 FOX*" on the gene name field 
returns the gene named HOXA9 and any gene whose name begins with the letters &quot;FOX&quot;. When 
searching on fields that consist of values containing more than one word (GO terms, coding SNPs, 
Pfam domains, and gene descriptions), the multi-word elements must be enclosed in single quotes. For
instance, a search on the description phrase &quot;forkhead box protein&quot; should be entered as 
&quot;forkhead box protein&quot;. Use the &quot;any&quot; and &quot;all&quot; options to determine 
whether the search should return any gene that matches any term (&quot;any&quot;) or only those 
genes that match all terms (&quot;all&quot;).</p>  
<p> 
To facilitate searching on multiple terms, the Gene Sorter provides the option to paste in or upload
a list of search terms. To paste in a list of terms, click the filter's <em>Paste List</em> button, 
then paste or type the terms into the text box. Terms must be separated by a space, a tab, or be 
entered on separate lines, and may not include wildcards. When you have completed the list, click 
the Submit button to return to the main Filter page. The file upload utility - accessed via the 
<em>Upload List</em> button - has a similar functionality.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Filtering based on numerical ranges</strong><br> 
Several of the gene fields can be filtered by specifying a numerical range within which the value 
must fall. Examples of fields in this category include expression ratios, Blastp data, and genome 
position. To use this type of filter, enter the minimum and maximum values delimiting the range in 
which you are interested. In some cases, the range of valid values is indicated in the filter 
box.</p> 
<p> 
The genome position filter requires the name of a chromosome (in the format <em>chrN</em>) in 
addition to the chromosomal start and end positions. To list all genes on a chromosome, enter only 
the chromosome name.</p>  
<p> 
Expression filters include &quot;any&quot; and &quot;all&quot; options to determine whether the 
search should return a gene if any of the tissue expression values meet the minimum and maximum 
criteria (&quot;any&quot;) or only if all tissue expression values meet the search criteria 
(&quot;all&quot;).</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Saving filter settings</strong><br> 
The Gene Sorter provides a mechanism for saving filter settings for use in future sessions. To 
preserve the current filter configuration, click the <em>Save Filter</em> button on the Filter page.
Type in a name for the filter, then click <em>Save</em> to save the filter and return to the Filter 
page.</p>  
<p> 
<strong>Loading a saved filter</strong><br> 
Once a filter configuration has been saved, you can retrieve it in later sessions by loading it back
into your Gene Sorter. To load the saved filter settings, click the <em>Load Filter</em> button on 
the Filter page. Click on the name of the filter you wish to load, then click the <em>Load</em> 
button. Click the <em>Submit</em> button on the Filter page to apply the filter settings to the Gene
Sorter.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Viewing a list of saved filters</strong><br> 
To display a list of filter settings that you have saved, click the <em>Save</em> button on the 
Filter page. If you have any saved filters, the Gene Sorter will display an <em>Existing Setups</em>
list that shows the filter names. To permanently remove a filter from the list, click on the name to
highlight it, then click the <em>Delete Existing Setup</em> button.</p>

<!-- Displaying sequence and text-based output -->
<a name="Download"></a> 
<h2>Displaying sequence and text-based output</h2> 
<p> 
The Gene Sorter's graphical presentation of data facilitates the visual observation of relationships
and patterns among the genes in the display. However, it is often useful to convert the data to a 
text-based format that can be easily saved to a file or loaded into another program, database, or 
spreadsheet for further analysis. The Gene Sorter provides a mechanism for saving the current 
display in a tab-delimited text file or showing a text-based view of the sequence underlying the 
current display.</p>  
<p> 
<strong>Creating text-based output</strong><br> 
To output the current Gene Sorter table as text, click the text button at the top of the page. The 
Gene Sorter will display each row of table data on a separate tab-delimited line.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Viewing the underlying sequence</strong><br> 
To display the protein, mRNA, or genomic sequence underlying the current Gene Sorter table, click 
the sequence button at the top of the page. On the Get Sequence page, select the desired sequence 
configuration settings that you'd like, then click the <em>Get Sequence</em> button. The Gene Sorter
will display a text-based list of FASTA format records for each gene displayed in the table. The 
FASTA records may be cut and pasted into Blat for further study.</p>
