<h1>LiftOver of tracks from previous to new assembly</h1>
<p> 
The tracks indicated by a &quot;ball&quot; logo (e.g., <img class="gbsInlineImg" 
src="../../../images/17.jpg" width="20" height="20"> and 
<img class="gbsInlineImg" src="../../../images/18.jpg" width="20" height="20">) have been lifted 
from a previous assembly of the same organism with a minimum of quality control scrutiny (e.g., have
been lifted from hg17 or hg18 to a later human assembly). The number indicated on the logo indicates
the version of the assembly that the track was lifted from. These tracks are provided to our users 
with the intent that they assist in interpretation of other data, but must be used with caution. Not
all annotations remain intact when lifted in this manner and in any case, cannot by definition 
contain any sequence that is new to the newer assembly.</p> 
<p> 
It should also be noted that tracks containing large regions will not lift as well because of the 
increased chance of spanning a region that has changed between the two assemblies.</p>
