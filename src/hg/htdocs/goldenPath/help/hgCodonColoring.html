<h1>Coloring Gene Predictions and Annotations by Codon</h1>
<p> 
The Genome Browser's codon coloring feature allows users to quickly validate and compare gene 
predictions and annotations. To turn on codon coloring, select the <em>genomic codons</em> option 
from the <em>Color track by codons</em> pull-down menu.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Color Legend</strong></p> 
<ul> 
  <li>
  <font color="00C200">bright green codons/lines</font>: methionine, including start codons</li> 
  <li>
  <font color="00CCCC">cyan text</font>: partial codon, either spliced or truncated</li> 
  <li>
  <font color="FF0000">red "*"</font>: stop codons</li> <li>black "X": error (e.g. truncated 
  last codon)</li> 
</ul> 
<p> 
All other codons are shown in the original track color, with codon boundaries indicated by 
alternating lighter and darker shades.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Details</strong><br> 
Each codon is colored and labeled in the direction of transcription. This coloring applies only to 
gene prediction and annotation tracks; thus the codon sequence is colored in reference to the genome
and not the associated mRNA. A gene prediction without a CDS will not be colored; these can be 
non-protein-coding RNAs or predictions where a CDS annotation was not provided in the original 
data.</p> 
<p>	
To view codon coloring, the option must be turned on, the track must be in squish, pack, or full 
display mode, and the browser must be zoomed-in to a level at which there is at least one pixel per 
codon. When zoomed out to large regions of the genome, the browser will not display codon coloring. 
To view labeling, the track must be zoomed to within 3 times the base level.</p>
