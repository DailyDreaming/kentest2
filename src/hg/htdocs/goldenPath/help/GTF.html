<!-- GTF format description.  This is used in the FAQ and custom tracks documentation -->
<p>
GTF (Gene Transfer Format, GTF2.2) is an extension to, and backward compatible with, GFF2. The first eight 
GTF fields are the same as GFF. The <em>feature</em> field is the same as GFF, with the exception that
it also includes the following optional values: <em>5UTR, 3UTR, inter, inter_CNS,</em> and 
<em>intron_CNS</em>. The <em>group</em> field has been expanded into a list of <em>attributes</em>. 
Each attribute consists of a type/value pair. Attributes must end in a semi-colon, and be 
separated from any following attribute by exactly one space.</p>
<p>
The attribute list must begin with the two mandatory attributes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <strong>gene_id <em>value</em></strong> - A globally unique identifier for the genomic source of 
  the sequence.</li>
  <li>
  <strong>transcript_id <em>value</em></strong> - A globally unique identifier for the predicted 
  transcript.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong><em>Example:</em></strong><br>
Here is an example of the ninth field in a GTF data line:
<pre><code>gene_id "Em:U62317.C22.6.mRNA"; transcript_id "Em:U62317.C22.6.mRNA"; exon_number 1</code></pre>
<p>
The Genome Browser groups together GTF lines that have the same <em>transcript_id</em> value. It 
only looks at features of type <em>exon</em> and <em>CDS</em>.</p>
