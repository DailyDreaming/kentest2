<h1>Help with the browser tracks image</h1>
<p>
If you are having difficulties viewing the Genome Browser, it may be a result of a recent update 
to our software. To clear up the tracks image, you can force a refresh/reload of the page in your 
Internet browser. Depending on which Internet browser you are using, you may need to hold down the 
Shift key while simultaneously clicking the &quot;reload&quot; button (or, in some browsers, 
Ctrl+R works). Once you have refreshed the page, the tracks image should display correctly.</p>
<p>
Sorry for any inconvenience. We hope that you understand that the website is continually 
evolving so that we can provide you with more features and data.</p>
