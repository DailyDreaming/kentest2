<h1>CRAM Track Format</h1>
<p>
The UCSC Genome Browser is capable of displaying both the BAM  and CRAM file formats. While BAM 
files contain all sequence data within a file, CRAM files are smaller by taking advantage of an 
additional external &quot;reference sequence&quot; file. This file is needed to both compress and 
decompress the read information.</p>
<p>
Since CRAM files are more dense than BAM files, many groups are switching to the CRAM format to save
disk space. For CRAM tracks to load there is an expectation that the checksum of the reference 
sequence used to create the CRAM will be in the CRAM header. A file with a matching checksum is also
expected to be accessible from the EBI CRAM reference registry (see <a href="#refs">References</a> 
for CRAM resources). Otherwise, users must specify a <code>refUrl</code> setting that will point to 
a server that is offering up the reference sequences (see <a href="#example4">Example Four</a>).</p>
<p>
Since the loading of CRAM data requires the specific reference sequence used to create the CRAM 
file, it is very important that the exact same reference sequence is used for compression and 
decompression. When a CRAM file is first loaded on a given chromosome, a check for the preexistence 
in a special browser &quot;cramCache&quot; directory of the specified reference checksum will take 
place. If the reference sequence information specific for that CRAM for the currently viewed 
chromosome region does not exist, a message will display about the file not being found along with 
a note about downloading the reference from the EBI CRAM reference registry if it is available (or 
from the specified <code>refUrl</code>). A refresh of the page once the download is complete will 
display the CRAM data as if it were a BAM file.</p>
<p>
The track lines to describe CRAM tracks are identical to track lines for BAM tracks. This includes 
the <code>type</code> parameter, which is still <code>bam</code> even for CRAM tracks. The only 
difference is that instead of providing the URL to a BAM file, the URL instead points to a CRAM 
file.</p>
<p>
Please also note that just as a BAM file requires an associated BAM.bai index file, a CRAM file will
require an associated CRAM.crai index file in the same location to load.</p>

<h2>Example #1</h2>
<p>
Here is an example CRAM track that displays around the gene SOD1 on hg19 that can be cut and pasted 
as text into the <a href="/cgi-bin/hgCustom?db=hg19" target="_blank">Custom Tracks</a> page:</p>
<pre><code>track type=bam db=hg19 name=exampleCRAM bigDataUrl=http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/cramExample.cram </code></pre>
<p>
Please note at the above URL location there is also a 
<code>http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/cramExample.cram.crai</code> file.</p>
<p>
Clicking this following link will also load the above track. The information following 
<code>hgct_customText</code> is equivalent to pasting the text in to the Custom Tracks page:</p> 
<pre><a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg19&position=chr21%3A33031597-33041570&hgct_customText=track%20type=bam%20name=exampleCRAM%20bigDataUrl=http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/cramExample.cram"
target="_blank"><code>http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg19&position=chr21%3A33031597-33041570&<strong>hgct_customText=</strong>track%20type=bam%20name=exampleCRAM%20bigDataUrl=http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/cramExample.cram</code></a></pre>

<h2>Example #2</h2>
<p>
If the URL to a CRAM file ends with .cram, you can paste the URL directly into the custom track 
management page, click submit and view it in the Browser. The track name will then be the name of 
the file. If you want to configure the track name and descriptions, you will need to create a track 
line, as shown in the above example. Learn more about track line options and configuring custom 
tracks <a href="hgTracksHelp.html#TRACK" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>
Here is an example URL to a CRAM file from the 1000 Genomes Project that can be pasted directly into
the <a href="/cgi-bin/hgCustom?db=hg19" target="_blank">Custom Tracks</a> page:</p>
<pre><code>ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/data/HG00096/exome_alignment/HG00096.mapped.ILLUMINA.bwa.GBR.exome.20120522.bam.cram </code></pre>
<p>
You can see by adding the above link the Browser automatically assigns the <code>type=bam</code> and
the <code>track name=HG00096.mapped.ILLUMINA.bwa.GBR.exome.20120522.bam</code> to the created track 
to browse.</p>
<p>
Clicking the following image will load a CRAM file from the 1000 Genomes Project.
<a href="../../cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg19&position=chr21%3A33031597-33041570&hgct_customText=track%20type=bam%20name=%22CRAM Example%22%20description=%22A%201000%20Genomes%20CRAM%20file%22%20visibility=full%20bigDataUrl=ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/data/HG00139/exome_alignment/HG00139.mapped.ILLUMINA.bwa.GBR.exome.20121211.bam.cram%20doWiggle=1"
target="_blank"><img src="../../images/session.hg19.cramExample.png"></a></p>
<p>
This CRAM display takes advantage of using the new &quot;density graph&quot; feature where the 
bam.cram reads are displayed as a bar graph by checking the box next to &quot;Display data as a 
density graph&quot; on the Custom Track Settings page.</p>

<h2>Example #3</h2>
<p>
The CRAM format is also supported in track hubs. Below is an example trackDb.txt stanza that would 
display a CRAM files from the 1000 Genomes Project. To learn more about using Track Hubs see the 
<a href="hgTrackHubHelp.html" target="_blank">User Guide</a> and associated Quick Start Guides to 
building hubs. Note that <code>type bam</code> is used to display CRAM files in hubs, just as 
<code>type bam</code>  is used in custom CRAM tracks.</p>
<pre><code>track cram61
type bam
shortLabel HG00361
longLabel This CRAM file is from the 1000 Genomes Project HG00361
visibility pack
bigDataUrl ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/data/HG00361/exome_alignment/HG00361.mapped.ILLUMINA.bwa.FIN.exome.20120522.bam.cram</code></pre>

<a name="example4"></a>
<h2>Example #4</h2>
<p>
If users do not register their reference sequence with the EBI CRAM reference registry then there is
the option to use a <code>refUrl</code> setting to point the browser to the appropriate place to 
find the reference sequence. The below example is a hub track stanza using the  <code>refUrl</code> 
option:</p> 
<pre><code>track cramExample
type bam
visibility full
shortLabel cramExRefUrl
longLabel This CRAM file points to a reference sequence specified by refUrl
refUrl http://university.edu/URL/cramRef/%s
bigDataUrl ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/data/HG00096/alignment/HG00096.mapped.ILLUMINA.bwa.GBR.low_coverage.20120522.bam.cram</code></pre>
<p>
The use of <code>refUrl</code> can also be employed on a custom track line:</p>
<pre><code>track type=bam db=hg19 name=cramExRefUrl
refUrl=http://university.edu/URL/cramRef/%s
bigDataUrl=ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/data/HG00096/alignment/HG00096.mapped.ILLUMINA.bwa.GBR.low_coverage.20120522.bam.cram </code></pre>
