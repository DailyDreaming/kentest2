<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows the BLAT alignments of your sequence(s) to the genome assembly. In the Genome 
Browser, alignments of nucleotides use color to highlight differences as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
  <font color="red"><strong>red:</strong></font> Genome and query sequence have different bases at 
  this position.</li>
  <li>
  <font color="orange"><strong>orange:</strong></font> The query sequence has an insertion (or 
  genome has a deletion / alignment gap) at this point.</li>
  <li>
  <font color="#9214FF"><strong>purple:</strong></font> The query sequence extends beyond the end 
  of the alignment.</li>
  <li>
  <font color="green"><strong>green:</strong></font> The query sequence appears to have a polyA tail
   that is not aligned to the genome.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Also, when the alignment has gaps in both the genome and query sequence, double horizontal lines are
drawn.</p>
