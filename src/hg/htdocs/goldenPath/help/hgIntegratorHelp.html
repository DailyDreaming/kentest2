<h2>Introduction</h2> 
<p>
The Data Integrator is a fast and powerful graphical interface that can combine and export data from
multiple tracks simultaneously.  Like the <a href="hgTracksHelp.html">Genome Browser</a> and 
<a href="hgTablesHelp.html">Table Browser</a>, it can combine data from the browser database, 
<a href="customTrack.html">user custom tracks</a> and 
<a href="hgTrackHubHelp.html">track hubs</a>.</p> 
<p> 
Using the Data Integrator, you can retrieve tab-separated text for the data underlying up to five 
tracks, combining multiple tracks' data for items whose genomic positions overlap the positions of 
items in the first selected track. Depending on your needs, you may:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>
  include all columns of all data sources in your query, or only the columns that you select.</li> 
  <li>
  query genome-wide (provided that the results are not so large that the connection times out), or 
  only for your regions of interest.</li> 
  <li>
  view results in your web browser window, or download to a local file, optionally compressed by 
  gzip.</li> 
</ul>
<p> 
The Data Integrator does not yet have many of the features of the <a href="hgTablesHelp.html">Table 
Browser</a> tool. For example, if you want to retrieve DNA sequence or GTF format, you will need to 
use the Table Browser.</p>

<a name="GetStarted"></a> 
<h2>Getting started: performing a simple query</h2> 
<p>
Follow these instructions to perform a basic query that intersects two or more tracks:</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Step 1. Pick a genome assembly</strong><br> 
Specify the genome assembly from which you'd like to retrieve the data by choosing the appropriate 
organism using the <strong>group</strong> and <strong>genome</strong> menus, then selecting the 
assembly version from the <strong>assembly</strong> menu. Note that changing the 
<strong>group</strong> menu causes the <strong>genome</strong> menu to refresh, and changing the 
<strong>genome</strong> menu causes the <strong>assembly</strong> menu to refresh. Assemblies that 
are uploaded as part of an <a href="hgTrackHubHelp.html#Assembly">assembly hub</a> will be available
under the hub's name in the <strong>group</strong> menu.</p>  
<p> 
<strong>Step 2. Pick a genomic region</strong><br> 
The Data Integrator allows you to choose the genomic regions for which you want output.</p>  
<ul> 
  <li> 
  To display all of the data records for the selected track(s), select 
  <select><option>genome</option></select> from the <strong>region to annotate</strong> menu (not 
  available for certain tracks with restrictions on data sharing).</li>
  <li> 
  To restrict the data to a specific position range, select 
  <select><option>position or search term</option></select> from the <strong>region to 
  annotate</strong> menu and type or paste the position into the box. Some examples of specific 
  positions include a chromosome name (<em>chrX</em>), a coordinate range within a chromosome 
  (<em>chrX:100000-400000</em>), or a scaffold name.</li>  
  <li> 
  To look up the position range of a genomic element -- such as a gene name, an accession ID, an 
  STS marker, etc. -- or keywords from the GenBank description of an mRNA, select 
  <select><option>position or search term</option></select> from the <strong>region to 
  annotate</strong> menu and then type your search term into the box. For assemblies that have gene 
  annotations, autocompletions of gene symbols are offered. If your search term matches more than 
  one track or item, then a pop-up will appear with matching items and positions; click an item to 
  select its position.</li> 
  <li> 
  To query multiple genomic regions, select <select><option>define regions</option></select> from 
  the <strong>region to annotate</strong> menu and then enter up to 1,000 regions in a 3- or 4-field
  <a href="../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1">BED</a> file format or as <em>chrom:start-end</em> 
  position ranges.</li> 
</ul> 
<p> 
<strong>Step 3. Configure your data sources</strong><br> 
The <strong>track group</strong> menu shows all the annotation track groups available in the 
selected genome assembly. The names correspond to the groupings displayed at the bottom of the 
Genome Browser annotation tracks page. When a group is selected from the menu, the 
<strong>track</strong> menu automatically updates to show all the annotation tracks available within
that group.</p>  
<ul> 
  <li> 
  To examine all the tracks available within a certain group (e.g., all gene prediction tracks), 
  select the group name from the <strong>track group</strong> menu, then browse the entries in the 
  <strong>track</strong> menu.</li> 
  <li> 
  Custom annotation tracks created during the current session are listed under the <strong>Custom 
  Tracks</strong> group.</li> 
  <li> 
  Each connected track hub will be listed as its own group under the <strong>track group</strong> 
  menu.</li>  
  <li>
  Clicking the "View table schema" link opens a new web browser tab with the Table Browser's schema 
  page which describes the data fields.</li>  
</ul> 
<p>
<img src="../../images/hgIntegratorAddTrack.png" alt="hgIntegrator add track" width="702" 
height="65"></p>
<p>
After selecting your track from the drop-down menus, click <button type="button">Add</button>. You 
may add up to five tracks.  Some tracks are not available when the region is set to 
<strong>genome</strong> due to the data provider's restrictions on sharing. See the 
<a href="#DataSources">Selecting Data Sources</a> section for more details.</p>  
<p> 
<strong>Step 4. Rearrange your data sources (Optional)</strong><br> 
You can rearrange your data sources by clicking on a track name and dragging it into the desired 
order. Items are output based on their overlap with the first listed track. The order of the tracks 
will also determine the order of the fields in the output. Fields from tracks higher in the list 
will appear first in the output.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Step 5. Choose output fields (Optional)</strong><br> 
Click <button type="button">Choose fields...</button> to bring up a checklist of all fields from all
selected data sources. By default, every field is selected. You can choose the columns you want in 
your output by checking the box next to that field. Additionally, you can add and select fields from
up to four related tables. See the <a href="#OutputConfig">Configuring Output</a> section for more 
details.</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Step 6. Get output</strong><br> 
Click <button type="button">Get output</button> to display the results of the query in the web 
browser window. The results will be displayed as tab-delimited text. Download results as a file by 
checking the box next to <strong>Send output to file</strong> and entering a file name into the box.
The output file can also be compressed by gzip.</p>

<a name="DataSources"></a>	
<h2>Selecting data sources</h2> 
<p>
The Data Integrator allows you to select up to five data sources to intersect. These data sources 
can be tracks provided by UCSC or your own data uploaded using <a href="../../../cgi-bin/hgCustom" 
target="_blank">custom tracks</a> or <a href="../../../cgi-bin/hgHubConnect" target="_blank">track 
hubs</a>. Only positional tables, such as BED, wiggle, and genePred, are currently allowed in the 
output. Other formats such as MAF or BAM are currently unavailable in the Data Integrator.</p> 
<p>
Items in your selected tracks are output based on their overlap with items in your primary track. 
The primary track is the one that shows up first in the list of your chosen data sources. In the 
following example, UCSC Genes would be the primary track and items would be output based on their 
overlap with items in UCSC Genes:</p> 
<p>
<img src="../../images/hgIntegratorDataSourceConfig.png" alt="hgIntegrator configure data
Sources" width="628" height="131"></p> 
<p>
The order of your selected tracks also affects the order of fields in your output. Fields from 
tracks that are higher up in the <strong>Configure Data Sources</strong> box will show up before 
tracks that are lower in that box. Using the same order of tracks seen in the previous example, this
means that fields from the UCSC Genes track will appear first in the output, then fields from DNase 
Clusters and lastly fields from Conservation - 100 Vert. El. However, your tracks aren't limited to 
the order in which you selected them, and you can rearrange the order of your tracks at any time. To
do so, just click and drag a track to a new position in the list. A track can be removed by clicking
the "<strong>X</strong>" next to it.</p>  
<p>
Some data providers stipulate that their data can be browsed visually in the Genome Browser, but 
cannot be provided for download via the Table Browser or Data Integrator. Tracks from those 
providers do not appear in the track menus. Other providers allow queries within specific regions, 
but not genome-wide queries. Their tracks appear in the menus, but are grayed out when region is set
to <strong>genome</strong>.</p>

<a name="Overlap"></a>
<h2>Computing item overlap</h2> 
<p>
The current intersection mechanism the Data Integrator uses is fairly simple. For gene transcripts, 
mRNAs, and any other tracks where the items have blocks or gaps, the overlap for the entire range of
the item is computed. This means that introns and gaps in the item are also considered when 
computing overlap. This is an improvement upon the Table Browser which only computed overlap with 
exons. For example, let's consider the following situation using the UCSC Genes and DNase Clusters 
tracks:</p> 
<p>
<img src="../../images/hgIntegratorHgTracksExample.png" alt="hgIntegrator hgTracks example" 
width="787" height="88"></p> 
<p> 
If we were using the Data Integrator to find the DNase peaks that overlapped with the gene in the 
UCSC Genes track, we would get all of the visible peaks in our output.</p> 
<p>
Additionally, items are output regardless of the amount of overlap. This means that if there is 
even a single base of overlap between two items, they are included in the output.</p>

<a name="OutputConfig"></a>
<h2>Configuring output</h2> 
<p>
By default, the Data Integrator outputs all fields of all data sources except for the 
<code>bin</code> column of database tables (a numerical index added by UCSC to speed up database 
queries). If you are interested in the data from a limited number of fields, you can customize the 
set of fields to include in the output. After selecting and configuring your data sources as 
described in the <a href="#DataSources">Selecting Data Sources</a> section, click 
<button type="button">Choose fields...</button> to begin configuring your output. After clicking 
the button, a pop-up with all the fields from your selected tables will appear:</p> 
<p>
<img src="../../images/hgIntegratorFieldsConfig.png" alt="hgIntegrator choose fields" width="574" 
height="353"></p>
<p>
Uncheck the box next to the field name to exclude it from the output; check the box if you change 
your mind and want to include it. You can quickly select or deselect all of the fields by clicking 
<button type="button">Set all</button> or <button type="button">Clear all</button> below the track 
name.</p>  
<p> 
In the UCSC Genome Browser database, detailed information on the annotations for many tracks is 
stored in extra tables. This information can include things such as identifiers in other databases, 
transcript status, or other descriptive information. You can select fields from up to four of these 
related tables for each of your selected tracks. After clicking <button type="button">Choose 
fields...</button>, you should see a section labeled &quot;Related tables&quot; below each track. 
This drop-down menu allows you to select and add related tables to your output.</p> 
<p>
<img src="../../images/hgIntegratorRelatedTablesAnnouncement.png" alt="hgIntegrator
"hgIntegrator related tables" width="684"
height="418"></p> 
<p> 
Note that not all tracks in the Genome Browser database will have related tables. Also, some tables 
may be unavailable when region is set to <strong>genome</strong> due to the data provider'
s restrictions on sharing. If no &quot;Related tables&quot; section appears for a particular 
selected track, then there are no related tables for this track.</p> 
<p>
After you have finished selecting your output fields and related tables, click 
<button type="button">Done</button> at the bottom of the dialog box to finish configuring your 
output.</p> 
<p>
If you want to view your results in the web browser window, simply click <button type="button">Get 
output</button>. Or, if you want to send your output to a file, check the box next to <strong>Send 
output to file</strong>. You can compress your output file using gzip by checking the box next to 
<strong>Compress with gzip (.gz)</strong>. Then click <button type="button">Get output</button> to 
begin downloading your file.</p> 
<p>
Note that for wiggle tracks, the &quot;Value&quot; field is averaged across the region of overlap.  
In the future, we intend to add an option to output all of the data values in that region of 
overlap.</p>  
<p> 
If a single item in the primary track has multiple matches in a secondary track, then the Data 
Integrator outputs multiple rows. Each row repeats the fields of the primary track item, and then 
adds fields of the <em>nth</em> matching item from each secondary track. If there are multiple 
secondary tracks, then their items will appear together in a row of output whether or not they 
overlap each other. For example, note how items overlap (or not) in the three tracks A, B and C in 
the image below:</p>
<p>
<img src="../../images/hgIntegratorHgTracksExample2.png" alt="hgIntegrator hgTracks example
2" width="731" height="102"></p> 
<p> 
Two items from track B (B1, B2) overlap the primary item (A). Three items from track C (C1, C2, C3) 
overlap the primary item (A). The Data Integrator prints 3 rows of output.  B1 and C1, although they
do not overlap, appear together in the first row of output. B2 and C2 appear together in the second 
row of output. The third row of output has empty fields for track B followed by C3's fields. This is
the output (when A, B and C are 4-field <a href="../../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1">BED</a> custom 
tracks; colors added for emphasis):</p> 
<pre><code>#A.chrom	A.chromStart	A.chromEnd	A.name	<span style="color: #960000;">B.chrom	B.chromStart	B.chromEnd	B.name</span>	<span style="color: #000096;">C.chrom	C.chromStart	C.chromEnd	C.name</span>
chr1	1200	1800	A	<span style="color: #960000;">chr1	1250	1350	B1</span>	<span style="color: #000096;">chr1	1425	1525	C1</span>
