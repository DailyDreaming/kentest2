<h1>Interface to UCSF Chimera</h1> 
<p>
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/download.html" target="_blank">Download</a> Chimera</br> 
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/current/docs/ContributedSoftware/webdata/webdata.html#browser" 
target="_blank">Configure</a> for automatic launch in web browsers</a></p> 
<p>
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/" target="_blank">UCSF Chimera</A> is an interactive 
molecular modeling system that supports 3-D visualization of protein structures.It runs as an 
application on the user's computer. The UCSC Genome Browser provides links to launch Chimera as a 
helper application for proteins with solved structures deposited in PDB. Protein residues with 
non-synonymous SNPs identified by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19369493" 
target="_blank">LS-SNP PDB</a> are annotated in Chimera by the UCSC Browser for genome assemblies 
with LS-SNP PDB entries (currently human).</p> 
<p>
Links to Chimera are available in the &quot;Protein Domain and Structure Information&quot; section 
of the <em>UCSC Genes</em> details page when the gene is associated with a PDB structure. Residues 
with non-synonymous SNPs are colored gold and labeled with the dbSNP identifier. Additionally, for 
SNPs in LS-SNP PDB, links to Chimera are generated on the SNP details page with the residue 
associated with the selected SNP colored red, and the other non-synonymous SNP residues colored 
gold.</p> 
<p>
Chimera version 1.3 or newer must be installed locally on your computer from the 
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/download.html" target="_blank">Download Chimera page</a>. 
To automatically launch Chimera from one of these links, it must be configured as a web browser 
helper application as described in the 
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/current/docs/ContributedSoftware/webdata/webdata.html#browser" 
target="_blank">Chimera Web Data page</a>.</p> 
<p>
<em><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> The UCSC Genome Browser group is unable to provide support for 
installing or using UCSF Chimera.  If you need help, please see the 
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docindex.html" target="_blank">UCSF Chimera 
Documentation</a> or inquire on the <a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/feedback.html"
