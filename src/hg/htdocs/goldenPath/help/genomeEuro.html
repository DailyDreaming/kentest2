<h1>Using a Supported Mirror Site</h1> 
<p> 
The UCSC Genome Browser hosts the following official mirror sites: the European mirror 
(genome-euro), located at the <a href="http://www.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/" 
target="_blank">Universit&auml;t Bielefeld Center for Biotechnology</a> in Bielefeld, Germany and 
the Asian mirror (genome-asia), located at the <a href="http://www.yokohama.riken.jp/english/" 
target="_blank">RIKEN Yokohama Campus</a>, Japan.</p> 
<p> 
These mirror sites are administered by UCSC and are meant to be alternate, faster access points for 
those Browser users who are geographically closer to central Europe or Asia than to the western 
United States.</p> 
<p> 
When users navigate to the U.S. server home page (and conversely, when U.S. users navigate to the 
European or Asian server) and click the &quot;Genomes&quot; menu item, they will receive a 
notification at the top of the window that they have been redirected to the more 
geographically appropriate server. At this point, one of two things can happen:</p> 
<ol> 
  <li>
  The user may choose to remain on the redirected server and proceed normally.</li> 
  <li>
  The user may click the provided link back to the original server. When this occurs, a cookie is 
  created in the user's Internet browser remembering this choice and in the future, no automatic 
  redirection will occur.</li> 
</ol> 
<p> 
The user may also manually select a server at any time by mousing over the "Mirrors" menu item, 
illustrated below. Note that manually selecting a server will also create a cookie that will 
disable automatic redirection. Automatic redirection can be re-enabled by clearing cookies.</p>

Many thanks to our colleagues at the Universit&auml;t Bielefeld Center for Biotechnology for hosting
genome-euro, and at RIKEN for hosting genome-asia.</p>

<h2>About Saved Sessions and Custom Tracks on Official Mirror Sites</h2> 
<p> 
When genome-euro was first activated in 2013, the genome-euro Saved Sessions database was an 
identical copy of the Saved Sessions database from the U.S. server, so Saved Session data were the 
same on the two servers, except for custom tracks. After the initial activation of genome-euro, 
however, the Saved Sessions between the two servers began to diverge.  New Saved Sessions or 
modifications to existing Saved Sessions are NOT copied from one server to the other, so a new 
Saved Session created on either server will NOT be available on the other. This is also the case on 
genome-asia (activated in 2016). Saved Sessions can be moved from one server to the other by saving 
them to a file and reloading the file using &quot;Save current settings to a local file:&quot; and 
&quot;Use settings from a local file:&quot; features on the 
<a href = "../../cgi-bin/hgSession">Sessions</a> page</p> 
<p> 
Custom Track data, including those Custom Tracks belonging to Saved Sessions, are NOT copied from 
the U.S. server to mirror sites. Any Custom Tracks that exist on either the U.S. server or a mirror 
site will need to be manually downloaded via the Table Browser or otherwise manually recreated if 
users would like them to be present on the other.</p> 
<p> 
Once Custom Tracks are loaded onto a mirror site, a Saved Session may be re-saved under the same 
name to reconstitute the original session with all associated Custom Tracks.</p> 
<p> 
If you would like your custom data to be easily available on an official mirror site and the UCSC 
Genome Browser site, we highly recommend creating a <a href="hgTrackHubHelp.html" 
target_="blank">Track Hub</a>.</p> 
<p> 
A track hub has the benefit of being hosted on your site allowing more control, ensuring data 
persistence, minimizing upload time to the browser, simplifying sharing of data, and optimizing 
track functionality.</p>
