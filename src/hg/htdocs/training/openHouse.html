  <h3>Thanks to all who attended the UCSC / ASHG Ancillary 2021 Virtual Open House</h3>

  <b>We will have another Open House in the future:  Another chance to meet our <a href = "../staff.html">staff</a>
    for Live Q & A </b>
  </p>

  <p>
  We know that the Genome Browser is a lot of things to a lot of people.  It is full-featured, which
  also means that it can sometimes be complicated.  
  <br>These events are an opportunity to ask questions in real time and meet
  the staff.
