  These instructions are designed to help you follow along with the tutorial.  At
  certain places within the tutorial, links are provided to help you see what
  your browser page should look like at that place.  Please feel free to ask questions
  as we progress.  If we do not get through all the steps, that means that a lively 
  session has taken place and we departed from the script.  That is a good thing.  
  We hope you find the
  session worthwhile and leave with a sense at least of what the Browser is and
  does, if not necessarily a full understanding of how to do everything.

  After the workshop, when you're playing with the browser on your own,
  <A HREF="#help">Help</A> is available via our mailing list.
