This is the one used in presentation to AWG.  Here's an excerpt from Anshul's email 
describing the data:
    The Rescue Ratio (Np/Nt) (Column AK) and the self consistency ratio (N1/N2) (Column AL) have the replicate agreement scores. Scroll over the headers to see what these are. If these numbers are greater than 2, we flag replicates as having poor reproducibility. Further by tracking individual replicate quality scores (library complexity, number of reads, cross-correlation), I can figure out which replicate is the problematic one. I flag them accordingly in Columns E,F,G and H.
