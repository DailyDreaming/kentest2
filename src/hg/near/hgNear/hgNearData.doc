This document describes the configuration system
for the hgNear (Gene Sorter) cgi-script.
The configurations are stored in the hgNearData directory.  
This directory contains subdirectories for each organism,
and sub-subdirectories for each assembly of the
organism.  Configuration information can appear at
any level of this directory structure, and stuff
at the lower levels overrides stuff at the higher
levels.

The configuration files currently are either .html or
.ra format.  Each column may have a column.html file
where 'column' is the symbolic name of the column.
This html file is displayed when the user clicks on
the label of a column.  The .ra files are in a simple
format in which records are separated by blank lines, 
and each field in a record is on its own line. The first 
word in a line is the name of the field.  All records begin 
with a name field.

The files are :
  genome.ra - genome-specific information that applies to
      all columns.
  columnDb.ra - this contains a record for each column.
  orderDb.ra - this contains a record for each potential
      way of sorting the rows.
A more detailed description of each of these files follows.

genome.ra - This file contains a single record.  Most fields
are required. The fields are:
    name - Always 'genome'.
    examples - Text to put in the examples section of the
       initial search terms page.  Things the program searches for.
    geneTable - Main table of genes in genePred format with an
       extra proteinID field as well with a SwissProt accession or
       display ID.
    canonicalTable - Table that says which transcript to display
       as representing the gene in cases where splicing variants are
       not displayed
    isoformTable - Table that associates all transcripts of a gene
       together.
    pepTable - Table with amino acid sequence for genes.
    mrnaTable - (optional) Table with mRNA sequence for genes.
    allTranscriptQuery - Query to select the five columns with
       gene ID, chromosome, start, end, and protein ID for all 
       transcripts of all genes.
    allGeneQuery - Query to select the five columns for the canonical
       transcript of each gene.
    oneGeneQuery - Query to select the five columns for a single gene
       given the gene ID.
    spDb - Name of the relationalized SwissProt database.

columnDb.ra - This file contains a record for each potential column.
Each record has a type field.  Some fields are common to many types
of columns, while others are type specific.  Here is a list of
the required fields for all columns:
    name - Symbolic name for column.  The user doesn't see this.
    shortLabel - Short (one or two word) user visible label for column.
    longLabel - One line description of column.
    priority - Defines default order of columns.  A floating point number.
    visibility - Defined default column visibility, either 'on' or 'off'
    type - Column type. This defines what code is associated with the
        column.  The first word in the field is the type itself.  
	In some cases there may be additional words which act as
	parameters.  See below for a detailed description of this field.
Here are optional fields common to most columns:
    itemUrl - (optional) Printf formatted string to create HREF part
        of hyperlink around item.  This should contain a single %s.
    search - (optional)  Controls how many column including
        lookup, association, knownName, and knownDetails type columns 
	are put into the seach string when the user types in a word in 
	the search box that is not a gene ID.  Values are:
	    exact - Only exact matches to column values cause hits
	    prefix - Any column values that start with search string
	       cause a hit.  
	    fuzzy - Any column values that include search string cause
	       a hit.
	If there is no search field present then the column is not searched.
    searchLabel - (optional) Label used for search hits to that column.
        If this is not present then the column's longLabel is used 
	instead.
    colWidth - (optional) If present forces column label to be at least
        this many characters wide.  In some cases this helps prevent
	excessive word-wrapping.
    selfLink - (optional) If present and nonempty causes hyperlink
        on this column to just select current gene as active.
The type of a column is determined by the first word in type field.
There may be additional parameters in subsequent words in the type field.
The types are:
    lookup - A column based on a simple database table lookup.
        Only a single value is associated with each gene ID. 
	It is ok for some gene ID's to have no associated value.
	Parameters: table, geneId field, value field.
        Associated fields:
	    noKeys - If present advanced search does not give
	        opportunity to paste in list of matching keywords.
	    xrefLookup - parameters are xrefTable, nameField, aliasField.
		xrefTable.nameField must join with table.geneIdField.
		If present, then lookup returns the alias instead of name.
	    xrefOrg - If present, xrefTable should be in the latest assembly
		for this organism.  Used only if xrefLookup is given.
		Spelling must exactly match the organism's dbDb.genome entry.
    association - A column based on database queries which can
        associate potentially multiple values with each gene.
	Parameters: tables that must exist for column to be displayed.
	Associated fields:
	    queryFull -  SQL query that returns two columns for all
	       genes: geneId and associated value.
	    queryOne - SQL query that returns two columns on a particular
	       gene: displayed value, value to put in URL hyperlink
	    invQueryOne - SQL query that returns gene ID given value.
	    protKey - (optional) If set, the proteinID rather than the
	        geneID is used.
    float - A column based on a simple database lookup of a number.
	It is ok for some gene ID's to have no associated value.
	Parameters: table, geneId field, value field.
    debug - A column that displays something to help debug, currently
        the distance value from the ordering.  This is only shown on
	hgwdev.
	Parameters: none
    num - This just counts from 1 to the number of genes displayed.
	The hyperlink for this table selects the gene.
        Parameters: none.
    knownName - Shows the name (as opposed to the gene ID) of the gene.
	The hyperlink for this table selects the gene.
        Parameters: same as lookup.  Table, geneId field, name field.
    acc - Shows the geneID.
        Parameters: none.
    knownPos - Shows the position in the genome and hyperlinks to the
        genome browser.
	Parameters: none.
    knownDetails - Prints a short description of the gene.
        Parameters: same as lookup.
	Associated fields: same as lookup.
    distance - Looks up a floating point value in a table using both the 
        id of the selected gene and the id of the gene for the current row.
	Usually used to show the distance between genes in some sense.
        Parameters: 
	    table - Table to look up distance in
	    curGeneField - Field that corresponds to selected gene ID.
	    otherGeneField - Field that corresponds to row's gene.
	    distanceField - A floating point value.
    pfam - Shows Pfam, protein family stuff. Similar to association but
        has some special pfam code so that it will display something
	prettier than just pfam ids.
	Parameters: tables that must exist for column to be displayed.
	Associated fields: same as association.  Also an additional
	    required protDb field that has the name of the current protein
	    database.
    go - Shows Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with gene.
        Parameters: none.
	Associated fields:
	    goaIdColumn - Which column of the go.goaPart table to
	        use to look up the proteinID from.  This is because
		in some cases the proteinID is the SwissProt ID
		and in other cases its the SwissProt accession.  It's
		better if it's the accession since they are more stable.
    expRatio - Shows selected expression data from one set of experiments
        as a ratio between tissue (or life cycle) specific expression 
	and overall expression.
	Parameters:

	        needs to be a name field and an expScores field in this
		table.  The expScores field is a comma-separated list of
		floating point values.
	    dataTable - Table with one row for each
	        experiment, which describes the data used for each
		position in the expScores list in the expressionDataTable 
		table.
	Associated fields:
	    representatives - comma separated list of the experiments to
	        display and the order to display them.  -1 is a key 
		value indicating to display a line to visually separate
		groups of experiments.

        either absolute or ratio.
