<H3>Description</H3>
This column shows the <A HREF="http://www.ensembl.org" TARGET=_blank>Ensembl</A> 
transcript ID associated with the gene. 

<P>Ensembl is an automatic gene prediction pipeline and a major genome 
database and web site run by the <A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/" TARGET=_blank>Sanger 
Institute</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/" TARGET=_blank>European 
Bioinformatics Institute</A> (EMBL-EBI). It is especially effective at 
mapping genes that are known in one organism to another organism.  
Compared to other gene predictions, those of Ensembl tend to have high 
specificity but low sensitivity to genes not already associated with 
characterized mRNA or protein sequence.

<H3>Action</H3>
