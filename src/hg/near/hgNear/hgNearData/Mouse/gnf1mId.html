<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This column shows the Affymetrix ID from the GNF1M chip
that best corresponds to each gene.</P>

<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>Target genome sequences were obtained from 
the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF)
and mapped to the genome using <tt>blat</tt> followed by <tt>pslReps</tt> with the parameters
-minCover=0.30 -minAli=0.95. For each gene, the most overlapping target (on 
the same strand and excluding introns) was selected.
