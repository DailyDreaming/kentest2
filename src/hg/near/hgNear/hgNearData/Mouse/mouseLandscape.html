<H3>Description</H3>
<P>
This column shows the expression of XM RefSeq mRNA transcripts corresponding to UCSC Known Genes.  Values 
correspond to basal expression levels of the transcripts in the various tissues.  White means a high level of 
expression, and black means no significant level of expression.  The values used are normalized by the authors 
on the raw intensites using a median-subtracted arcsinh variance-stabilizing normalization method where 
negative values are zeroed out.

<B>Brightness:</B> To increase or decrease the brightness of the expression colors,
edit the number in the column's <em>brightness</em> text box. Values greater 
than 1.0 increase the brightness, while those less than 1.0 dim the color. The default brightness 
for this track is set at 1.5 because it's a bit dark.</LI>
