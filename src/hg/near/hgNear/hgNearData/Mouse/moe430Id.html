<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This column shows the Affymetrix ID from the MOE430 series of chips (A & B)
that best corresponds to each gene.</P>

<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>Target genome sequences were downloaded from the
<A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=moe430" TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix Product Support</A> website
and mapped to the genome using <tt>blat</tt> followed by <tt>pslReps</tt> 
with the parameters -minCover=0.3 -minAli=0.95 -nearTop=0.005. For each gene,
the target with the most overlap (on the same strand and excluding introns) 
was selected.
