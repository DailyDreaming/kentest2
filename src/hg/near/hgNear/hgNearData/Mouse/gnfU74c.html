<H3>Description</H3>
<P>
This column shows the expression of genes in
<A HREF="http://expression.gnf.org/mouse_annot.html">specific tissues</A>
using the Affymetrix U74c chip.  Together with the GNF U74a and GNF U74b 
columns, this displays the Mouse Gene Expression Atlas 1 from the Genomics Institute 
of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF).
Currently, the full spectrum of tissues is only available on the U74a chip.
<P>
By default, the column shows the ratio of expression of a gene in a specific 
set of tissues to the expression of the gene overall. A gene that is more highly 
expressed in a tissue is colored red, and a less expressed gene is shown in 
green. The values are colored on a logarithmic scale. This coloring is standard, 
but is the opposite of what an inexperienced user 
might expect: in this case, red means go and green means stop!  
Black indicates that a gene is neither over- nor under-expressed in the tissue. 
Uncolored boxes (white on most browsers) represent missing data.  

<H3>Column Configuration</H3>
Several column configuration options are available on the Configuration page, 
which can be accessed via the <em>configure</em> button in the top menu.
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Absolute expression values:</B> The display can be configured to show 
absolute expression values rather than ratio values. To toggle the display, 
select the <em>absolute</em> option from the <em>values</em> pulldown menu. 
Absolute expression values
are shown in shades of gray, with higher expression levels shown in lighter 
shades. As with ratio values, absolute values are colored on a logarithmic 
scale.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Color scheme:</B> Color-blind users can switch the coloring scheme from red/green to 
yellow/blue via the <em>Expression ratio colors</em> pulldown menu at the top
of the Configuration page.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Level of tissue detail:</B> The <em>tissue</em> pulldown menu
controls the amount and type of tissue data displayed. By default, only the 
median values for selected tissues are shown.  To display the value of all 
individual experimental replicates of all tissues, 
select the <em>all replicates</em> option. To view a single median value for each 
tissue, choose the <em>median of replicates</em> option.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Brightness:</B> To increase or decrease the brightness of the expression colors,
edit the number in the column's <em>brightness</em> text box. Values greater 
than 1.0 increase the brightness, while those less than 1.0 dim the color. </LI>
</UL>

<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>For detailed information about the experiments, see Su et al., 
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11904358&dopt=Abstract"
TARGET=_blank>"Large-scale analysis of the human and mouse transcriptomes."</A>, 
<I>PNAS</I>, Mar 19, 2002. </P>
<P>When calculating expression ratios, the overall expression level in the
denominator was calculated by first taking the median of replicates for
each non-cancerous tissue,  and then taking the median of these medians.
