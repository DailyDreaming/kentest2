<H3>Description</H3>

This column shows the maximum expression value in
adult male and female mouse tissue as described in
Rinn et al., &quot;The major molecular differences between mammalian sexes are 
involved in drug metabolism and renal function&quot;, <em>Developmental Cell</em> 
<B>6</B>(6), 791-800 (2004). 

<H3>Methods</H3>
Five adult mouse tissues liver, kidney, hypothalamus, ovary and testis, 
were studied.  For each somatic tissue, triple selected poly-A mRNA was prepared from 
6 independent pools (biological replicates), 3 male and 3 female.  Likewise, 3 pools 
were prepared from the ovary and 3 pools from the testis.  Each pool of RNA was derived 
from 10 individuals. Furthermore, for each biological replicate two cDNAs (technical 
replicates) were prepared and independently hybridized to Affymetrix MOE430A chips.
