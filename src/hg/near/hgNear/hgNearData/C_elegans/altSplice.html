<H3>Description</H3>
This column displays instances of alternatively-spliced exons
detected by examining mRNA and EST alignments. Spliced instances are
indicated by the word &quot;exon&quot;.

<H3>Methods</H3>
The first pass was done with tools developed for the
<A HREF="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~kent/intronerator" TARGET=_blank>Intronerator</A>.
This was followed by a second, manual curation pass by
members of the 
<A HREF="http://www.biology.ucsc.edu/people/zahler/" TARGET=_blank>Zahler lab</A>.
The manual curation selected exons that are included in some isoforms
but not others and for which there was solid evidence.
