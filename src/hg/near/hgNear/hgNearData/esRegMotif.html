<H2>Description</H2>
This column shows the predicted transcription factor binding
sites that correlate with expression of the gene.

<H2>Methods</H2>
The approach underlying this annotation is described in Segal, E.  et al., 
<A HREF="http://robotics.stanford.edu/~erans/publications/segal_promoters.pdf"
TARGET=_blank>Genome-wide discovery of transcriptional modules from DNA 
sequence and gene expression</A>, <em>Bioinformatics</em> <B>19</B>(Suppl 1),
i273-i282 (2003). 
The analysis was performed on various pre-existing microarray datasets.
A regulatory module is comprised of a set of genes predicted to be regulated 
by the same combination of DNA sequence motifs. Predictions are based on the
co-expression of the set of genes in the module and on the appearance of
common combinations of motifs in the upstream regions of genes assigned to
the same module.
