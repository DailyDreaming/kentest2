<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This column shows the predicted regulatory module (a combination
of transcription factor binding sites) that regulates the gene.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The approach underlying this annotation is described in Segal, E. et al., 
<A HREF="http://robotics.stanford.edu/~erans/publications/segal_promoters.pdf"
TARGET=_blank>Genome-wide discovery of transcriptional modules from DNA 
sequence and gene expression</A>, <em>Bioinformatics</em> <B>19</B>(Suppl 1),
i273-i282 (2003). The analysis was performed on various pre-existing 
microarray datasets. A regulatory module is comprised of a set of genes 
predicted to be regulated by the same combination of DNA sequence motifs. 
Predictions are based on the co-expression of the set of genes in the module 
and on the appearance of common combinations of motifs in the upstream 
regions of genes assigned to the same module. 

<H2>Action</H2>
<P>
To view genes that share a regulatory module, select the <em>Regulatory 
Module</em> option from the <em>sort by</em> menu.
