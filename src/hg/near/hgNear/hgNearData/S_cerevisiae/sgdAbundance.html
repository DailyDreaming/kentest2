"<A HREF="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6959/abs/nature02046.html" 
TARGET=_blank>Global analysis of
protein expression in yeast</A>", <em>Nature</em> 425:737-741. 
This study used a <EM>Staph. aureus</EM> protein-A tag fused to 
each yeast ORF to measure the absolute expression levels of each protein by quantitative 
immunoblotting.
