<H3>Description</H3>
This column shows the bit score measure of protein similarity between a 
gene and the selected gene. The greater the similarity between two proteins, 
the higher the bit score.

<H3>Method</H3>
All known splice variants of all known $organism genes are
put into a <tt>blast</tt> protein database using the <tt>formatdb</tt> program.
This database is then searched with each known gene using
version 2.2.5 of the NCBI <tt>blastall</tt> program with the following
flags:
<PRE>
 -p blastp -e 0.01 -m 8 -b 1000
</PRE>
These flags indicate to the program to do a protein-based search and report
up to 1000 hits of e-value 0.01 or better in a tab-delimited
format. The output from this search is loaded into the Gene Sorter database.
