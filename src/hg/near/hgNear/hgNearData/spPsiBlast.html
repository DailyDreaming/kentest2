<H3>Description</H3>
<p>
This column shows the <tt>PSI-BLAST</tt> E-value (expectation value) between 
the Swiss-Prot or TrEMBL protein associated with the gene and one associated 
with the selected (highlighted) gene. The greater the similarity of two 
proteins, the lower the E-value is.  Identical long proteins have an E-value 
of zero.
</p>

<H3>Method</H3>
<p>
PSI-BLAST was run on the $organism proteins from the
Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL databases of 15 November 2004
in an all-versus-all fashion using the following flags:</p>

<pre>
    -j 5  -e 1000 -v 1000 -b 0
</pre>
These flags tell the program to do a maximum of 5 iterations and
output a maximum of 1000 hits at E-values up to 1000.

<p>Each protein is mapped to its associated known gene.  Proteins that cannot 
be mapped are dropped.  For each of the remaining pairs of aligned proteins,
the best E-value under 10.0 is kept.
</p>

<H3>Action</H3>
<p>
Click on a gene's E-value to display an alignment between the gene and the 
selected (highlighted) gene.
