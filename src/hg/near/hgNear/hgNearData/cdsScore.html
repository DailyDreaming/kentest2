<H3>Description</H3>
<P>
This column shows the coding-potential score generated by the txCdsPredict 
program. This
program weighs a variety of evidence, including the presence of a Kozak 
consensus sequence at the start codon, the length of the ORF, the presence of 
upstream ORFs, homology in other species, and nonsense-mediated decay. In 
general a score over 1000 almost certainly indicates that the transcript codes
for a protein, and scores over 800 indicate approximately a 90% chance that a 
protein is produced.</P>
