<H3>Description</H3>
This column shows the FlyBase ID of the best <tt>blastp</tt> match to the FlyBase 
protein set.

<H3>Action</H3>
Click on the FlyBase ID to display the corresponding FlyBase report.

<H3>Method</H3>
The NCBI <tt>blastall</tt> program was run with the following parameters:
<PRE>
 -p blastp -e 0.01 -m 8 -b 1
</PRE>
In the most recent assemblies, the best blat matches were then pruned to 
retain only the reciprocal-best matches.
