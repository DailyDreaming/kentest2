<H3>Description</H3>
This column shows the <tt>blastp</tt> E-value (expectation value) between each gene 
and the selected gene. The greater the similarity of two proteins, the lower 
the E-value is.  Identical long proteins have an E-value of zero.
<P>
Formally, an E-value is the number of other known genes that are 
expected to have at least this level of homology by chance. An E-value of 
less than 0.1 can be safely interpreted as the probability that a match 
this good would occur merely by chance.

<H3>Method</H3>
All known splice variants of all known $organism genes are
put into a <tt>blast</tt> protein database using the <tt>formatdb</tt> program.
This database is then searched with each known gene using
version 2.2.5 of the NCBI <tt>blastall</tt> program with the following
flags:
<PRE>
 -p blastp -e 0.01 -m 8 -b 1000
</PRE>
These flags tell the program to do a protein-based search and report
up to 1000 hits of E-value 0.01 or better in a tab-delimited
format. The output of this search is loaded into the Gene Sorter database.

<H3>Action</H3>
Click on a gene's E-value to display an alignment between the gene and the 
selected (highlighted) gene.
