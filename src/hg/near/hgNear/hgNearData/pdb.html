This column displays all 
<A HREF="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/" TARGET=_blank>Protein Data Bank</A> (PDB)
IDs associated with the gene.
PDB is a database of proteins with known 3-D structures.  
In some cases these records will correspond to only a fragment of the
gene.  In other cases the PDB record may include other molecules with which
the protein interacts.  

<H3>Action</H3>
Click on the PDB ID to display the associated PDB Structure Explorer page.

<H3>Methods</H3>
The PDB IDs are extracted from Swiss-Prot.
