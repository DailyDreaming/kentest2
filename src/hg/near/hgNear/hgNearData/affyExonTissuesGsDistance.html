<H3>Description</H3>
<P>
This column shows the similarity of the expression (distance) from the Affymetrix All 
Exon dataset of each gene to the selected gene. Genes with identical expression profiles show a value 
of zero. This column shows data only for the 1000 genes (including
splicing variants) that have the most similar expression
profiles.
</P>

<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>
RNA (from a commercial source) from 11 tissues was hybridized to Affymetrix 
All Exon 1.0 ST arrays. For each tissue, 3 replicate experiments were done 
for a total of 33 arrays.  The arrays' raw signal intensity was normalized
with a quantile normalization method, then run through the PLIER algorithm.
The normalized data were then converted to log-ratios, which are displayed
as green for negative log-ratios (under-expression), and red for positive 
(over-expression).</P>
<P>When calculating expression ratios, the overall expression level in the
denominator was calculated by first taking the median of replicates for
each tissue and then taking the median of these medians. </P>
<P>
To associate particular genes with expression data, the following algorithm
was used: for each gene, the overlapping exons from the microarray dataset
were collected and the median intensity of these was assigned to the gene.
If the gene contained exons not overlapping an exon from the microarray,
those exons were ignored. If the microarray dataset contained exons not
overlapping a gene, those were ignored as well.  Once the overall expression
level of each gene was determined, the log-ratio was calculated.  In addition,
the median was taken for replicate arrays per tissue for both the absolute 
and log-ratio varieties.</P>
<P>
The expression distance between two genes is a weighted
sum computed with the following formula:
<PRE>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delta(a,b) = sum(w[i] * |a[i] - b[i]| ) / sum(w[i])
</PRE>
where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are expression vectors associated with the two
genes indexed by a microarray, <em>w</em> is an array of weights, and the
sums are taken over all microarray.  Each microarray is weighted equally in this
case, because all tissues have three replicates.
