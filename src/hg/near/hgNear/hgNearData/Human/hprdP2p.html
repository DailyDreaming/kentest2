<H3>Description</H3>
<P>
This column shows the neighborhood of protein interactions surrounding the 
selected gene. The neighborhood is computed from a genome-wide protein-protein 
interaction network. The network connects genes if the proteins they encode 
have been detected to physically interact in high-throughput experiments.</P>

<P>
The network distance listed in the column shows the number of interactions 
between a gene and the selected gene. For example, genes whose protein 
products have been detected to directly interact are listed with a network 
distance of one. Genes that share a direct interaction with a protein that 
also directly interacts with the selected gene are listed with a distance of 2. 
For example, if the protein of gene X interacts with the protein of gene Y 
(but not the protein of the selected gene), and Y's protein interacts with the 
selected gene, then gene X will have a distance of 2.</P>

<P>
For protein-protein interactions in "complex" multi-protein associations, 
the distance 1.5 was used instead of 1.0
since it is not necessarily known that the two proteins are in direct contact.
</P>

<P>
Because the protein interaction network is highly connected (i.e. most genes 
are connected to one another by some distance), we limited the size of the 
neighborhood to contain only those genes within a pre-specified distance 
(2 by default).</P>

<H3>Example Protein-Interaction Network</H3>
<IMG src="../images/hprdGenedist.png"><br>

Distance AB is 1 because proteins from genes A and B interact directly.<br>
Distance AD is 2 because proteins from genes A and D interact indirectly through gene C protein.<br>
Distance AA is 1 because the gene A protein is known to interact directly with itself.<br>
Distance AE is 1.5 because proteins from genes A and E are involved in a "complex" interaction cluster
but A and E are not known to directly interact.<br>
