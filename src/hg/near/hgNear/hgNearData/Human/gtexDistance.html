<H3>Description</H3>
This column shows the similarity of the expression of each gene 
to the selected gene. Genes with identical expression profiles show a value of 0.
This column shows data only for the 1000 genes that have the most similar expression
profiles.

<H3>Methods</H3>
The expression distance between two genes is
computed as the average of the difference in
expression ratios over all tissues assayed in the GTEx project.
