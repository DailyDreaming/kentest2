<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This column shows the Affymetrix ID from the HG-U133 Plus 2.0 chip
that best corresponds to each gene.</P>

<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>Target genome sequences were downloaded from the
<A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=hg-u133-plus"
TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix Product Support</A> website and mapped to the 
genome using 
<tt>blat</tt> followed by <tt>pslReps</tt> with the parameters
-minCover=0.3 -minAli=0.95 -nearTop=0.005. For each gene, the target with
the greatest overlap (on the same strand and excluding introns) was chosen.
