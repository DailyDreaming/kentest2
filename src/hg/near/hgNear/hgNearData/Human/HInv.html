<P>
This column shows the <A HREF="http://www.jbirc.aist.go.jp/hinv/ahg-db/index.jsp" 
TARGET=_blank>H-Invitational Gene Database</A> (HInv-DB) ID associated with 
the gene, if available. 
<P>
The HInv-DB is a human gene database containing human-curated annotation of 
41,118 full-length cDNA clones representing 21,037 cDNA clusters. The 
project was initiated in 2002 and the database became publicly available in 
April 2004.
<P>
HInv-DB entries describe the following entities:
<UL>
<LI>gene structures</LI>
<LI>functions</LI>
<LI>novel alternative splicing isoforms</LI>
<LI>non-coding functional RNAs</LI>
<LI>functional domains</LI>
<LI>sub-cellular localizations</LI>
<LI>metabolic pathways</LI>
<LI>predictions of protein 3D structure</LI>
<LI>mapping of SNPs and microsatellite repeat motifs in relation with orphan diseases</LI>
<LI>gene expression profiling</LI>
<LI>comparative results with mouse full-length cDNAs gene structures</LI>
</UL>

A full description of the construction of the HInv-DB is contained in the 
report by the H-Inv Consortium (see References section).

<H3>Credits</H3>
<P>
The H-InvDB is hosted at the Japan Biological Information Research
Center (JBIRC).
The human-curated annotations were produced during invitational annotation
meetings held in Japan during the summer of 2002, with a follow-up
meeting in November 2004.  Participants included 158 scientists
representing 67 institutions from 12 countries.
</P>
<P>
The full-length cDNA clones and sequences were produced by the
Chinese National Human Genome Center (CHGC),
the Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ/MIPS),
Helix Research Institute, Inc. (HRI),
the Institute of Medical Science in the University of Tokyo (IMSUT),
the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (KDRI),
the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC/NIH) and the
"Full-Length Long Japan" (FLJ) project.
