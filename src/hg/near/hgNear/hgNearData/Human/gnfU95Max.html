<P>This shows the maximum absolute expression level for any tissue.
Most of the values fall in the zero to 30,000 range, but a few outliers may
range as high as 52,000. A value of less than 20 indicates the expression
could not be detected in any tissue at levels significantly above the 
cross-hybridization controls.  </P>
