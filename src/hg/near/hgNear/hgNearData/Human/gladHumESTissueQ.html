<P>
This column shows tissue corresponding to the Gladstone Q-value.

<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>
The H-value and Q-value were both calculated based on expression of 
probes on a GNF microarray.  These probes are associated to genes by 
aligning the probe set to the genome.  Based on the expression of a 
gene on the microarray, Shannon entropy calculations yield scores for 
each gene's specificity to a certain tissue (the Q-value) and its 
overall specificity (H-value).  In the case of the Q-value, only the lowest
value is shown, corresponding to the tissue to which the gene has the 
highest specificity.</P>
