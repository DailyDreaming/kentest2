<H3>Description</H3>
<P>
This column shows the ID of the probe in the GNF Atlas 2 that overlaps most 
with the selected gene.  The GNF Atlas 2 is based on 
two Affymetrix chips: the U133A and a custom-designed GNF1H chip.  

<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>Target sequences for U133A were downloaded from the
<A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=hgu133-20"
TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix Product Support</A> website. Target sequences for 
GNF1H were obtained from GNF via personal correspondence. The sequences were 
mapped to the
genome using <TT>blat</TT> followed by <TT>pslReps</TT> with the parameters 
-minCover=0.3 -minAli=0.95 -nearTop=0.005. For each gene, 
the target with the greatest overlap (on the same strand and excluding 
introns) was chosen.
