<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This column shows the Affymetrix ID from the HG-U95 chip
that best corresponds to each gene.</P>

<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>Target genome sequences were downloaded from the
<A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=hgu95" 
TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix Product Support</A> website and mapped to the genome 
using <TT>blat</TT> followed by <TT>pslReps</TT> with the parameters
-minCover=0.3 -minAli=0.95 -nearTop=0.005. For each gene, the target with the
greatest overlap (on the same strand and excluding introns) was chosen.
