<H3>Description</H3>
<P>
This column shows gene expression in 53 tissues
based on RNA-seq data from the 
<A TARGET="_blank" HREF="https://commonfund.nih.gov/GTEx/index">
Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEX) project</a>.
To view the GTEx tissues in anatomical context, see the 
<A TARGET="_blank" HREF="../gtexBodyMap.html">
GTEx Body Map</a>.
<P>
By default, the column shows the ratio of expression of a gene in  
different tissues to the expression of the gene overall. A gene that is more highly 
expressed in a tissue is colored red, and a less expressed gene is shown in 
green. Values are colored on a logarithmic scale. 
Black indicates that a gene is neither over- nor under-expressed in the tissue. 
Uncolored boxes (white on most browsers) represent missing data.  
While admittedly somewhat counter-intuitive, these conventions are standard
in gene expression datasets (from microarray technology).

<H3>Column Configuration</H3>
These options are available on the Configuration page, 
which can be accessed via the <em>configure</em> button in the top menu.
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Absolute expression values:</B> The display can be configured to show 
absolute expression values rather than ratio values. To toggle the display, 
select the <em>absolute</em> option from the <em>values</em> pulldown menu. 
Absolute expression values
are shown in shades of gray, with higher expression levels shown in lighter 
shades. As with ratio values, absolute values are colored on a logarithmic 
scale.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Color scheme:</B> Color-blind users can switch the coloring scheme from red/green to 
yellow/blue via the <em>Expression ratio colors</em> pulldown menu at the top
of the Configuration page.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Tissues:</B> By default, only selected tissues are shown.  
To display all 53 tissues, choose <em>all</em> from the pulldown menu.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Brightness:</B> To increase or decrease the brightness of the expression colors,
edit the number in the column's <em>brightness</em> text box. Values greater 
than 1.0 increase the brightness, while those less than 1.0 dim the color. </LI>
