# For 2x75 datasets, raw Illumina reads (RawData, fasta format, query75.txt files) are run through bowtie 0.9.8.1 with up to 2 mismatches 
# and the resulting mappings are stored (RawData2, bowtie format, hg18sp75spike.bowtie.txt files) for up to ten matches per-read to the genome, 
# spiked controls and UCSC knownGene splice junctions. Reads that were not mapped by bowtie (RawData3, fasta format, unmapped.fa files) 
# are then mapped onto the genome using blat and filtered using pslReps (RawData4, psl format, bowtierej.hg18.blatbetter files). 
# The bowtie and blat mappings are then analyzed by ERANGE3.0.2 to generate wiggles (RawSignal, wiggle format, .graph files), 
# bed files of all reads and splices (Aligns, PairedAligns, bed format, all.bed files), 
# all bowtie and blat splices (Splices, bed format, allsplices.bed files), 
# and blat-only splices (Splices, bed format, blatsplices.bed), 
# as well as RPKM expression level measurements at the gene-level (RawData5, rpkm format, final.rpkm), 
# exon-level (RawData6, rpkm format, gencode_exon.rpkm), and candidate novel exons (RawData7, rpkm format, accepted.rpkm).
