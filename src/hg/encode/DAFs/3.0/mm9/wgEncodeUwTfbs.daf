# Data Agreement File for UW Chip-Seq (TFBS) experiments for mm9

#$Revision: 1.1 $

# This file specifies the data agreement between your lab and 
# the DCC.  It should not be changed unilaterally.

# The header for the associated DDF should look like this:
#files   view    cell 	antibody   sex     age     strain  replicate	control   tissueSourceType      seqPlatform   labVersion


#Explanation of DDF terms
#files: The name of the files to be associated with this data
#view: The type of view that these files are. The options are listed in this DAF
#cell: The cell or tissue name. The cell registered vocbulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Mouse_cell_types
#antibody: The antibody used for a specific target.The antibody registered vocbulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Antibodies
#sex: The sex of the individual the tissue originated or cell sex type. The sex registered vocabulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Controlled_vocabularies_for_ENCODE_data_reporting#Sex
#age: The age of the sample used. The age registered vocabulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Mouse_Metadata

#replicate: The Replicate number. The replication number of a given experiment.
#control: The input used as control for ChIP-seq data. The control registerd vocabulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Controlled_vocabularies_for_ENCODE_data_reporting#Controls
#tissueSourceType: The collection srouce of the tissue, either Pooled or Individual mice
#seqPlatform: The sequencing platform.The sequence platformregistered vocbulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Controlled_vocabularies_for_ENCODE_data_reporting#Sequence_Platforms
#labVersion: Free text for the lab to keep track of any other data
