# Data Agreement File $Revision: 1.9 $

# This file specifies the data agreement between your lab and 
# the DCC.  It should not be changed unilaterally.

# The header for the related .ddf should look like this:
# files	view replicate	cell	readType	mapAlgorithm	insertLength	labVersion	softwareVersion	origAssembly
#
#files          a list of files that correspond to the metadata in this line
#view           the view of the data as described below
#replicate      the replicate number, note that it will only work if the view has (hasReplicates yes)
#cell           the cell line (http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/cellTypes.html)
#readType       the read type (single, paired, directional, length) (http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/otherTerms.html#readType)
#mapAlgorithm   the mapping algorithm (http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/otherTerms.html#mapAlgorithm )
#insertLength   the insert length for the read (ttp://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/otherTerms.html#mapAlgorithm )
#labVersion     free text for the lab to specify metadata (possibly 'These files produced for use with GENCODE V3c' or something of the like) (OPTIONAL)
#softwareVersion free text for the lab to specify Cufflinks V??? You can also clarify your mapAlgorithm here (OPTIONAL)
#origAssembly   optional Specifies if this is new data (hg19) or remapped data (hg18)  (OPTIONAL) THIS HELPS CRICKET ALOT
#
#NOTE:  The optional columns do not have to be in the DDF for validation.  They do not show up in the file names, just the metadata.
