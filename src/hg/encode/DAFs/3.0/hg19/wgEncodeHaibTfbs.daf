#protocol: The specific PCR protocol used. The protocol registered vocbulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Controlled_vocabularies_for_ENCODE_data_reporting#Protocols
#setType: The identification if either the data refers to an experiment (exp) or is input (input) for another experiment.
#controlId: The unique identification of experiments. The control ID gerneated from the lab.
#labExpId; A unique lab identification number for an experiment.
#replicate: The Replicate number. The replication number of a given experiment.
#softwareVersion: Free text for the lab to keep track of software used in processed data
#labVersion: Free text for the lab to keep track of any other data
