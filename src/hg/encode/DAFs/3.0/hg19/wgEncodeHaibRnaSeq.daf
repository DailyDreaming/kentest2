# Data Agreement File for Myers RNA-seq project $Revision: 1.3 $

# This file specifies the data agreement between your lab and 
# the DCC.  It should not be changed unilaterally.


# The header for the related .ddf should look like this:
# files view replicate  cell rnaExtract treatment readyType mapAlgorithm origAssembly labVersion labExpId
#

#files          a list of files that correspond to the metadata in this line
#view           the view of the data as described below
#replicate      the replicate number, note that it will only work if the view has (hasReplicates yes)
#cell           the cell line (http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/cellTypes.html)
#rnaExtract     the features the RNA was selected on (long, short, polyA+) (http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/otherTerms.html#rnaExtract)
#treatment      the treatment on the cell (http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/otherTerms.html#treatment)
#readType       the read type (single, paired, directional, length) (http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/otherTerms.html#readType)
#mapAlgorithm   the mapping algorithm (http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/otherTerms.html#mapAlgorithm)
#origAssembly   optional Specifies if this is new data (hg19) or remapped data (hg18)  
#labVersion     free text for the lab to specify metadata (possibly 'These files produced for use with GENCODE V3c' or something of the like) (OPTIONAL)
#labExpId       allows the lab to tag the files with own internal experiment ID (optional)
