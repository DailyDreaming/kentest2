# Data Agreement File $Revision: 3.0 $
#
# This file specifies the data agreement between your lab and
# the DCC.  It should not be changed unilaterally.

# The header for the related .ddf should look like this:
# files view cell localization  protocol  labVersion  
#
#files          a list of files that correspond to the metadata in this line
#view           the view of the data as described below
#replicate      the replicate number, note that it will only work if the view has (hasReplicates yes)
#cell           the cell line (http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/cellTypes.html)
#protocol       In-gel or FASP or MudPIT
#labExpId	for the lab to specify any internal experimental ID
#labVersion     free text for the lab to specify metadata (possibly 'These files produced for use with GENCODE V3c' or something of the like) (OPTIONAL)
#softwareVersion free text for the lab to specify software version.
#
#NOTE:  The optional columns do not have to be in the DDF for validation.  They do not show up in the file names, just the metadata.
