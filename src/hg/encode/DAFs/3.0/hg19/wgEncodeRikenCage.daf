# Data Agreement File for RIKEN CAGE project $Revision: 1.9 $

# This file specifies the data agreement between your lab and
# the DCC.  It should not be changed unilaterally.

# The header for the related .ddf should look like this:
# files	view	cell	localization	rnaExtract	labProtocolId	labExpId	bioRep	origAssembly	replicate
#
#files          a list of files that will be concatenated together
#view           the view of the data as described below
#cell           the cell line (http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/cellTypes.html)
#localization   the cellular compartment (http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/otherTerms.html#localization)
#rnaExtract     the features of rnaExtract (http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/otherTerms.html#rnaExtract )
#labProtocolId  Transcriptome specific lab protocol ID, can be comma separated list for pooled
#bioRep         Transcriptome specific bioRep ID, can be comma separated list for pooled
#labExpId       optional lab internal identifiers, can be comma sepated list for pooled
#origAssembly   optional Specifies if this is new data (hg19) or remapped data (hg18)
#replicate      the replicate number, note that it will only work if the view has (hasReplicates yes)
#
#NOTE:  The optional columns do not have to be in the DDF for validation
