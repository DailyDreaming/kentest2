# Data Agreement File for Genome Institute of Singapore ChIA-PET experiments  $Revision: 1.1 $

# This file specifies the data agreement between your lab and 
# the DCC.  It should not be changed unilaterally.

# The header for the related .ddf should look like this:
#files	view	cell	antibody	replicate	labExpId labVersion
#
#files          a list of files that correspond to the metadata in this line
#view           the view of the data as described below
#cell           the cell line (http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/cellTypes.html)
#antibody	the antibody used (http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/antibodies.html)
#replicate      the replicate number, note that it will only work if the view has (hasReplicates yes)
#labExpId     	for the lab to spcify their internal experiment ID
#labVersion     free text for the lab to specify metadata
