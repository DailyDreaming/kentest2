#Explanation of DDF terms
#files: The name of the files to be associated with this data
#view: The type of view that these files are. The options are listed in this DAF
#lab: The lab that originally submitted the data. The lab registered vocabulary can be found at:  http://hgwdev.soe.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=%22lab%22
#dataType: The data-type of the files. The dataType controlled vocabulary can be found at: http://hgwdev.soe.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=%22dataType%22
#cell: The cell name. The cell registered vocbulary is found at: http://hgwdev.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/cellTypes.html
#antibody: The antibody used for a specific target.The antibody registered vocbulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Antibodies
#treatment: The treatment used to treat a specific cell. The treatment registered vocabulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Controlled_vocabularies_for_ENCODE_data_reporting#Treatments
#protocol: The specific PCR protocol used. The protocol registered vocbulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Controlled_vocabularies_for_ENCODE_data_reporting#Protocols
#control: The specific control used for ChIP-Seq experiments. The control registered vocabulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Controlled_vocabularies_for_ENCODE_data_reporting#Controls
#softwareVersion: Free text for the lab to keep track of software used in processed data. Can track which version of SPP and PeakSeq used.
#labVersion: Free text for the lab to keep track of any other data. Track IDR threshold
