#Explanation of DDF terms
#files: The name of the files to be associated with this data
#view: The type of view that these files are. The options are listed in this DAF
#cell: The cell name. The cell registered vocbulary is found at: http://hgwdev.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/cellTypes.html
#treatment: The treatment used to treat a specific cell. The treatment registered vocabulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Controlled_vocabularies_for_ENCODE_data_reporting#Treatments
#antibody: The antibody used for a specific target.The antibody registered vocbulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Antibodies
#protocol: The specific PCR protocol used. The protocol registered vocbulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Controlled_vocabularies_for_ENCODE_data_reporting#Protocols
#setType: The identification if either the data refers to an experiment (exp) or is input (input) for another experiment.
#controlId: The unique identification of experiments. The control ID gerneated from the lab.
#labExpId; A unique lab identification number for an experiment.
#replicate: The Replicate number. The replication number of a given experiment.
#origAssembly: The assembly that the data was originally released on (hg18 or hg19)
#seqPlatform: The sequencing platform.The sequence platformregistered vocbulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Controlled_vocabularies_for_ENCODE_data_reporting#Sequence_Platforms
#softwareVersion: Free text for the lab to keep track of software used in processed data
#labVersion: Free text for the lab to keep track of any other data
