# Data Agreement File for Caltech ChIP-seq (Transciption Factor Binding Sites) experiments for mm9

#$Revision: 1.2 $

# This file specifies the data agreement between your lab and 
# the DCC.  It should not be changed unilaterally.

# The header for the associated DDF should look like this:
#files   view    cell    antibody	treatment	protocol	 sex  control readType replicate setType controlId   labExpId	 seqPlatform       softwareVersion labVersion md5sum


#Explanation of DDF terms
#files: The name of the files to be associated with this data
#view: The type of view that these files are. The options are listed in this DAF
#cell: The cell or tissue name. The cell registered vocbulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Mouse_cell_types
#antibody: The antibody used for a specific target.The antibody registered vocbulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Antibodies
#treatment: The treatment used to treat a specific cell.The treatment registered vocabulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Controlled_vocabularies_for_ENCODE_data_reporting#Treatments
#protocol: The specific PCR protocol used. The protocol registered vocbulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Controlled_vocabularies_for_ENCODE_data_reporting#Protocols
#sex: The sex of the individual the tissue originated or cell sex type. The sex registered vocabulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Controlled_vocabularies_for_ENCODE_data_reporting#Sex
#control: The input used as control for ChIP-seq data. The control registerd vocabulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Controlled_vocabularies_for_ENCODE_data_reporting#Controls
#readType       the read type (single, paired, directional, length) (http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/otherTerms.html#readType)
#replicate: The Replicate number. The replication number of a given experiment.
#setType: The identification if either the data refers to an experiment (exp) or is input (input) for another experiment.
#controlId: The unique identification of experiments. The control ID gerneated from the lab.
#labExpId; A unique lab identification number for an experiment.
#seqPlatform: The sequencing platform.The sequence platformregistered vocbulary is found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Controlled_vocabularies_for_ENCODE_data_reporting#Sequence_Platforms
#softwareVersion: Free text for the lab to keep track of software used in processed data
#labVersion: Free text for the lab to keep track of any other data
#md5sum: md5sum of file
