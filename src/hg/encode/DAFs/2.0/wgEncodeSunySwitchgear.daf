# Data Agreement File for Switchgear project $Revision: 1.1 $
# This file specifies the data agreement between your lab and 
# the DCC.  It should not be changed unilaterally.

# The header for the associated .ddf file should look like this:
# files   view    cell  ripTgtProtein  labVersion 

#
#files          a list of files that correspond to the metadata in this line
#view           the view of the data as described below
#cell           the cell line (http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/cellTypes.html)
#ripTgtProtein  The target protien used.  In our database these are mixed with antibodies, found at: http://encodewiki.ucsc.edu/EncodeDCC/index.php/Antibodies
#labVersion     free text for the lab to specify metadata (possibly 'These files produced for use with GENCODE V3c' or something of the like) (OPTIONAL)
#softwareVersion free text for the lab to specify Cufflinks V??? You can also clarify your mapAlgorithm here (OPTIONAL)
