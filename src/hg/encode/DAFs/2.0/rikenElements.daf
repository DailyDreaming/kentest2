# Data Agreement File for RIKEN Elements project $Revision: 1.1 $

# This file specifies the data agreement between your lab and
# the DCC.  It should not be changed unilaterally.

# The header for the related .ddf should look like this:
# files	view	cell	localization	rnaExtract	labProtocolId	labExpId	replicate
#
#files          a list of files that will be concatenated together
#view           the view of the data as described below
#cell           the cell line (http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/cellTypes.html)
#localization   the cellular compartment (http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/otherTerms.html#localization)
#rnaExtract     the features of rnaExtract (http://genome-test.soe.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/otherTerms.html#rnaExtract )
#labProtocolId  Transcriptome specific lab protocol ID, Can be comma separated list
#labExpId       optional lab internal identifiers, Can be comma separated list
#replicate      pooled
#
#NOTE:  The optional columns do not have to be in the DDF for validation
