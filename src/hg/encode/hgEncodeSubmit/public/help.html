Welcome to the Data Coordination Center (DCC) data submission website! 
On this site you can submit your data and metadata files to the DCC as a 
compressed archive.  This help file describes the process you should
to submit, validate, and load your data, and provides step-by-step 
navigation of the submission website. 
</DIV>
</P>

<DIV id="content">
<H3>Overview of the data submission process</H3>
<P>
Before submitting data, each contributor should work with the 
DCC staff to create a data agreement. This will specify the file formats
you should use for your project's data files and the metadata that describe 
these data files.
<P>
Once the data agreement is finalized and your data archive has been created, 
you can submit data to the DCC using these steps:
<OL>
<LI> Create a DCC submission account and log in.
<LI> Create a project entry.
<LI> Submit the data archive to the project.
<LI> Verify that the submission was accepted.
<LI> When notified by the DCC, approve your data track(s) in the browser.
</OL>
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV id="content">
<H3>Creating an account/logging in</H3>
<P>
Prior to submitting data, you must first create a login account. To do so, 
click the &quot;Sign up&quot; link on the Data 
Submission <A HREF="/">home page</A>. 
Fill in the text boxes, then click the &quot;Sign Up&quot; button. An 
acknowledgement message will be sent to the email address you indicated; click 
the URL in the message to activate your account and display the login page.
</P>
<P>
Once you've activated your account, you can directly log in to the Data 
Submission website in the future by clicking the &quotLog in&quot; link on the 
<A HREF="/">home page</A>. 
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV id="content">
<H3>Creating a project</H3>
<P>
Before submitting data to the DCC, you must first create a DCC project with 
which the data will be associated. Subsequent data sets can be loaded to the 
same project instance or added to a new project.</P>
<P>
To create a project, click the &quot;New Project&quot; menubar link, enter the 
project name in the text box, and click the &quot;Create&quot; button. You will
then be prompted to load your data archive into the project (see &quot;Loading
data into a project&quot;). If you are not yet ready to load data into 
your new project, click the &quot;Cancel&quot; button. 
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV id="content">
<H3>Loading data into a project</H3>
<P>
After creating a new project, you will be prompted for a file, URL, or 
FTP site from which the project data should be loaded. Note that your data file 
must be in one of the standard archive formats accepted by the submission 
website: .zip, .tar.gz, .tgz, or .tar.bz2.  
</P>
<A name="ftpHelp"></A>
<P>
You may optionally use the FTP space provided if you wish.
Any FTP client can be used to upload your archive to your FTP space.
The FTP login, site, and port are visible in the ftp link shown on the upload page.
Use your same login and password for FTP. Archives with the correct extension
that have been uploaded to your FTP space will appear in the dropdown
list on the upload form. Simply choose the desired archive. You may need to click refresh
after uploading your archive to your FTP space.
</P>
<P>
Once you've specified a source for your data, clicking the &quot;Submit&quot; button
will automatically upload, expand, validate, and load into the database your data archive.
While the data is loading, the project webpage
will display a green status bar -- this disappears when the load is complete.
If you are manually stepping through the load process, click the 
&quot;Validate&quot; and then &quot;Load&quot; links on the project page to 
finish the submission process on your data archive.
</P>
<P>
If a problem is encountered while submitting your data, the webpage will 
display an error message at the bottom of the page and the data archive status 
column will list the submission step that failed. In this situation, you must 
create an archive containing corrected versions of the problem files and 
resubmit these data to the project. Feel free to 
<A HREF="/contact">contact</A> the DCC staff for assistance if any 
error messages are unclear.
</P>
<P>
To load data into a previously created project, click the &quot;My 
Projects&quot; menubar link to list your projects, then click the 
project in the &quot;Name&quot; column to display information about that
project. Click the &quot;Submit Data&quot; link to load a data archive into that
project.
</P>
</DIV>

<DIV id="content">
<H3>Viewing/editing projects</H3>
<P>
To view a list of the projects in your account, click the &quot;My
Projects&quot; menubar link. This page lists all of your active projects, the 
current status of each, and the date/time when each was last modified. You can 
edit any of the projects in the list by clicking its link in the 
&quot;Name&quot; column, which displays the individual project details page. 
(If you have only one project, clicking the &quot;My Projects&quot; link will 
take you directly to the details page for that project.)
</P>
<P>
On the project details page you can remove 
(&quot;Delete Project&quot; link) or rename (&quot;Rename Project&quot; link) a
project. You can add a new data archive to the project (&quot;Submit Data&quot; 
link) or remove an existing data archive by clicking 
the &quot;Delete&quot; link to the right of the archive's status column.
If the most recently submitted data archive (i.e. the archive at the top
of your list) has not been validated and/or loaded, you can finish the load
process by clicking the &quot;Validate&quot; and &quot;Load&quot; links.</P>
<P>
To display a list of all the projects present on the DCC server, click the 
&quot;All Projects&quot; menu bar link. Although you will be able to view
details about other submitters' projects, you will not be able to 
edit or remove projects or data that do not belong to you.
