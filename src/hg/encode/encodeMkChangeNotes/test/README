The test structure works like this:


You must have PYTHONPATH point to your source tree's libraries, otherwise you're testing against the installed library,
which you should never change.

The mkChangeNotes Library is tested against the CurrentMkChangeNotes in the directory.
When you make changes to mkChangeNotes, the test will create a local instance of it
and see if any critical functions have changes.
It will also check that any critical variables haven't changed.
Lastly, it will check if the output is the same.

If you are significantly changeing the output, with no logic changes, don't worry about failing
the End to End tests. 

If you are changing the logic, and it's a transparent change, you should pass all tests.

If you are adding feature, you should make sure you know what you are doing, as things will probably break, and the
test will fail.

Once you are satisfied that your changes are ok, have someone else test them (by hand, not using this suite)
and when you get the OK, copy the new mkChangeNotes Library to CurrentMkChangeNotes, turning it into the new
standard. 

Install the library and you'll be good to go.
