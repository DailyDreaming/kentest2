The testing struture for this goes as follows:

The tester.pl script will use doEncodeValidate one directory up as the one you use.

It will then look in all the folders below it for test.cfg.

It parses the file then runs doEncodeValidate on the folder.

Print Results.

To make more tests, simple make a folder where an error will occur (I think all the positive tests are already there)
and make a test.cfg file.

To disable a test, simple rename a test.cfg file.
