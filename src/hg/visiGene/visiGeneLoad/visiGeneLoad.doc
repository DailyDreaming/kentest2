LOADING DATA INTO VISIGENE

To load images into VisiGene we need four types of files.
  1) The images themselves, preferably in JPEG format, but
     we can convert from TIFF and most other formats as well.
  2) A file in what we call a .ra format that describes things
     that are common to all the images in a group.  
  3) A tab-separated text file that contains one line for each
     image in the submission.
  4) A caption text file (optional).  This is also a tab separated
     file.  The first column is the captionId associated with the
     comment, the second column is the comment itself (with no tabs
     or newlines).

In general the loading system is flexible whether information goes
in the .ra file or in the tab separated file.  

Optionally there will be a fourth file that contains information
about the expression levels observed in various anatomical parts
according to the image(s).

OVERVIEW OF .RA and .TAB FILES

The input to visiGeneLoad is a .ra file and a tab-separated file.
Both .ra and .tab files contain tagged values.  In the .ra file the tag 
is the first word of a line, and the rest of the line is the value.  Note that
blank lines are *not* allowed in the .ra file.   In the tab-separated
file the tags for each column are contained in the first row,  which
should start with a '#' character, and then contain the column names
in a tab-separated manner.  Subsequent rows contain the values for
a particular image.  The program creates the database first by looking
for fields in the tab-separated file,  and then in the .ra file.

REQUIRED FIELD IN .RA FILE

contributor - A comma separate list of contributers.  Each contributer is of
    the form last name followed by initials.  There is a period, but no space
    after each initial.  Example:  Kent W.J., Haussler D., van Braun W.S.D
submissionSource - Typically the name of the lab or project behind the images.
submitSet - name of submission set.

REQUIRED FIELD IN .TAB FILE

fileName - The name of the image file (not including full directory).  
imageWidth - Width of image in pixels.
imageHeight - Height of image in pixels.
submitId - an ID to substitute into itemUrl for image.

REQUIRED FIELDS THAT CAN BE IN EITHER .RA or .TAB FILE

fullDir - The directory where the full-sized version of image lives.
thumbDir - Directory where thumbnail-sized version of image lives.
age - days since conception embryo.
probeColor - color of probe.
taxon - NCBI taxon of organism in image.

OPTIONAL FIELDS (WITH DEFAULT VALUES IF ANY IN BRACKETS)

abName - Name of antibody used as probe
abDescription - Description of antibody used as prob
abTaxon - Taxon of animal antibody isolated from
abSubmitId - an ID to substitute into abUrl for antibody.
abUrl - Contributor-supplied URL associated with this particular antibody.  Should
    have a %s where abSubmitId gets substituted in.
bac - If probe is made from a bac, the bac's name, often RP-something.
bodyPart - Name of part of body depicted in image.  Use "whole" for whole mounts.  
captionId - Same as in caption.txt file.
copyright - Copyright notice.
embedding - usually either 'cryosection' or 'paraffin'
fixation - formaldehyde, methanol, etc
fPrimer - Forward PCR primer used to generate RNA probe
genbank - Genbank/EMBL accession 
gene - HUGO or other official gene symbol
genotype - 'wild type' or comma separated list of mutations in format gene:allele
imagePos [0] - Zero based index of image in file
itemUrl - Contributor-supplied URL associated with this particular image.  Should
    have a %s where submitId gets substituted in.
journal - Name of journal
journalUrl - Main URL of journal.
locusLink - LocusLink/Entrez Gene ID
minAge - Minimum age of specimen.  Defaults to age.
maxAge - Maximum age of specimen.  Defaults to age.
paneLabel - Label of pane within multi-paned image file.
permeablization - How poked holes in whole mounts.  Proteinase K 30 min, etc.
preparationNotes - notes on preparation of specimen (info not contained in
    embedding, fixation, permeablization, slice type)
priority [200] - sort order.  Lower numbers shown first.
refSeq - RefSeq mRNA accession
rPrimer - Reverse PCR primer used to generate RNA probe
sectionIx [0] - zero based index of section in sectionSet
sectionSet - an identifier that groups together sections of same sample
sex - male, female, hermaphrodite, or mixed.
sliceType - whole mount, frontal, sagittal, transverse, etc.
specimenName - Name of specimen (John Doe).
specimenNotes - Free text notes on specimen.
strain - particular strain of specimen (eg C57BL for a mouse)
publication - Title of associated publication.
pubUrl - URL of associated publication
setUrl - Contributor-supplied URL associated with whole submitted set of images
seq - probe sequence
uniProt - Uniprot accession
year - Year of publication or contribution to database.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN INDENTED LINES OF TAB FILE

The tab-separated file may include extra, optional, information in
addition the to information described by the # header line.  This
information is in lines that are indented.  

Currently all indented lines must start with the keyword "expression".
The format of expression lines is:
	expression	bodyPart	level	cellType	cellSubtype	pattern
where bodyPart is same as the bodyPart elsewhere, and level is a
number between 0.0 and 1.0.   The cellType, cellSubtype and pattern are optional
and may be omitted.  The pattern is typically something like "scattered" or
"regional."
