This directory is where users can put stuff that they want source controlled in the tree,
but not code that they yet want to share with other people.  Once other people do want to
use your code, consider polishing it up and putting it in the ../lib and ../program directories
instead.  Code under here is not code-reviewed.  Code in ../lib and ../program is.
